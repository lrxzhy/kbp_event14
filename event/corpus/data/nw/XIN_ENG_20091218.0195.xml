Brazilian supreme court shelves child Sean's return to U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BRASILIA, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court
Thursday suspended the return of 9-year-old Sean Goldman to the
United States, where his father lives.
</P>
<P>
Marco Aurelio de Mello, a judge of the supreme court, shelved the
Wednesday decision of the Federal Regional Court of Rio de
Janeiro to send Goldman, saying the will of the child himself
must be heard and made known.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Sean must remain in Brazil at least until 2010, as the
court will recess from Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sean is son of the U.S. man David Goldman with the Brazilian
woman Bruna Bianchi, who brought him to her country five years
ago under the pretext of a vacation.
</P>
<P>
Bianchi got divorced from Goldman and married a lawyer in Brazil.
But in August 2008, she died from complications in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
Since the mother's death, the custody of the child has been
disputed between the father and the Brazilian family.
</P>
<P>
Even U.S. President Barack Obama requested his Brazilian
counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to help realize Sean's
return to the United States.
