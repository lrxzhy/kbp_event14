A Pakistani man arrested during the investigation of the failed Times Square bombing is due back in federal court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
A detention hearing is scheduled on Friday for Aftab Ali Khan, who is charged with immigration fraud and lying to investigators. He is not accused of knowing about or trying to participate in the botched attack.

A criminal complaint says that Khan gave $4,900 to Faisal Shahzad, of Bridgeport, Connecticut, who was later convicted in the bombing attempt. Federal prosecutors said it was part of a transaction to get an equivalent amount of money to Khan's family in Pakistan.

<P>
The complaint says the 28-year-old Khan, who lived in Watertown, got married after entering the U.S. in 2009, then filed false papers to adjust his immigration status without disclosing an illegal job.
