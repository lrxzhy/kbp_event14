Chinese President Hu Jintao has called on the entire nation to do more to ensure the safety of children, state press said Tuesday, in comments that follow a spate of grisly school killings.
</P>
<P>
"The entire society must pay importance to the safety of children and do everything to safeguard our motherland's next generation," the People's Daily quoted Hu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hu was speaking Monday as he toured a Beijing exhibit on transport and building safety with a group of schoolchildren on the eve of International Children's Day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks come after a spate of bloody school attacks around China since late March which have left 17 people dead, including 15 students, and scores injured.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the senseless assaults reveal a China struggling to come to grips with rapid social change following decades of booming economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a 47-year-old unemployed man was executed for carrying out an assault on 32 people, mostly small children, at a kindergarten in eastern China in April. The man, Xu Yuyuan, wielded a knife usually used to slaughter pigs.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who was sentenced to death on May 15, told the court his motive was to vent his rage against society after losing money gambling and in business dealings, and suffering setbacks in his personal life.
</P>
<P>
In late April, a former doctor who stabbed eight schoolchildren to death in a March school attack was executed.
</P>
<P>
Two other school assailants have committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
Premier Wen Jiabao said last month that long-standing social concerns including joblessness and a gaping rich-poor divide were partially to blame for the string of attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We need to resolve the deep-seated causes that have resulted in these problems," Wen said in an interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television.
</P>
<P>
"This includes handling social contradictions, resolving disputes and strengthening mediation at the grassroots level."
