A court on Saturday sentenced a female Saudi journalist to receive 60 lashes for her links with a Saudi-owned Lebanese TV network which broadcast a provocative racy show in July.
</P>
<P>
Rosanna al-Yami said a Jeddah judge dropped all charges that she had been directly involved with a programme on Beirut-based network LBC in which a Saudi man boasted of his sex life, outraging Saudi conservatives and leading to the man's imprisonment.

<P>
However, Yami said the judge sentenced her to 60 lashes for having been a part-time employee for LBC's Saudi operations. The judge said that LBC had lacked the appropriate operating license.

<P>
"It's a punishment for all journalists through me," Yami told AFP by telephone.
</P>
<P>
"They just said the channel was illegal. But the Saudi minister of information himself appeared on LBC a couple week ago," she said.
</P>
<P>
Yami's sentencing comes after airline sales clerk Mazen Abdul Jawad was convicted of offensive behaviour and sentenced to five years in jail and 1,000 lashes on October 7 for his July appearance on the LBC show "Bold Red Line" in which he talked about picking up girls and having sex with them.
</P>
<P>
Three friends who appeared on the show with him were given two-year terms and 300 lashes each, while a cameraman who helped film the episode was sentenced to two months in jail.
