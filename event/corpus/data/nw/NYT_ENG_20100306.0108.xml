PATERSON REWARDS REDEMPTION WITH A PARDON
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
      Gov. David A. Paterson announced Saturday that he had pardoned a
man whose rise from poverty and street crime in Chinatown to
success as an information technology executive was about to end in
deportation.
</P>
<P>
      The case of the man, Qing Hong Wu, who immigrated to the United
States legally as a child, had drawn support from many, including
the judge who sentenced him to a reformatory in 1996 and promised
to stand by him if he redeemed himself.
</P>
<P>
      "Qing Hong Wu's case proves that an individual can, with hard
work and dedication, rise above past mistakes and turn his life
around," Paterson said of the pardon, which will stop deportation
proceedings against Wu and could open the door to American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
      Supporters and relatives were jubilant on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
      "First of all, we want to thank the governor for saving Qing
Wu's life," said Elizabeth OuYang, the president of an
Asian-American civil rights organization that led the campaign to
free Wu from an immigration jail in New Jersey and keep him in the
country.
</P>
<P>
      "It has been an amazing rainbow of people who have come
together to stop his removal in the midst of a very broken
immigration system," she added.
</P>
<P>
      While Wu's family and friends rejoiced, he remained in the
Monmouth County Correctional Institute in Freehold, N.J., unaware
that his life had turned around once more.
</P>
<P>
      He was taken there from immigration headquarters in Manhattan on
Nov. 10. It was his application for citizenship that brought Wu,
29, to the attention of immigration authorities almost 15 years
after he committed a series of muggings with other teenagers in
Lower Manhattan. In a parallel system of immigration law
enforcement that makes no allowances for rehabilitation, the court
hearing his case had no discretion to consider the exemplary life
he had led after emerging from the reformatory.
</P>
<P>
      As a "criminal alien," he was subject to mandatory detention
and deportation to China, which he had not seen since he was 5 and
where he knew no one.
</P>
<P>
      OuYang said a full and unconditional pardon should not only
prevent the federal government from deporting Wu, but should be
grounds for granting him citizenship "so he can come full circle,
where he started when this whole mess began."
</P>
<P>
      The pardon was announced at the conclusion of a tumultuous week
for Paterson in which top aides resigned and he faced calls for his
resignation over accusations that he had abused the powers of his
office.
</P>
<P>
      Morgan Hook, a spokesman for the governor, said that "the
federal government will be notified that he had been pardoned, and
they will determine the next steps, as far as ending the removal
proceedings and releasing him."
</P>
<P>
      The link between Wu and the judge who sentenced him, Michael A.
Corriero, was described in an article in The New York Times last
month. Wu wrote to the now-retired judge from detention reminding
him of the promises that they exchanged at his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
      Corriero had forgotten the case, but checked the old court
transcripts and found that he had told Wu, then 16, "This is
really the beginning of a new period for you."
</P>
<P>
      "You will want to get a job and become a meaningful,
constructive member of society to help your family." The judge
then added, "I will be there to make sure you can."
</P>
<P>
      After the article appeared, hundreds of readers signed an online
petition urging that Paterson grant a pardon.
</P>
<P>
      The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., called the
governor express his approval of that course.
</P>
<P>
      In December, Paterson pardoned a soldier whose conviction for
gun possession had prevented him from joining the New York Police
Department. The soldier, Spc. Osvaldo Hernandez of Queens, had been
arrested in 2002 after a pistol was found under a seat in his car.
</P>
<P>
      He joined the Army after his release from prison and served 15
months in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne. After the pardon, he
left for another tour there.
</P>
<P>
      In May 2008, the hip-hop performer Ricky Walters, who had been
convicted in 1991 of attempted murder and weapons offenses, was
pardoned by the governor. Walters, known as Slick Rick, had also
faced deportation, to Great Britain, because of his criminal
record.
