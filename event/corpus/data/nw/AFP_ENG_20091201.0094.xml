Bolivian President Evo Morales, seeking reelection in weekend elections, said Tuesday the law would be changed so a conservative opposition candidate and his running mate could be jailed for corruption.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to change the law and the two of them can go to jail," said Morales, running for a second term in Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to both Manfred Reyes Villas, who is under investigation for corruption while in office in Cochabamba, and his running mate Leopoldo Fernandez who was detained a year ago in a La Paz jail.
</P>
<P>
Morales, the socialist incumbent, said the two were "thieves who steal the people's money."
</P>
<P>
The former coca leaf growers union leader Morales is positioned to be comfortably reelected to a second term in Sunday's presidential vote, a new poll showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
He stands to receive some 55 percent of the vote, according to an Ipsos-Apoyo survey of 2,980 people published in La Razon newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Morales was elected to his first term in office in 2005 and is the first indigenous Bolivian elected president in a majority indigenous nation.
</P>
<P>
He is trailed by his right-wing opponents, economist and businessman Samuel Doria Media and Reyes Villa, a former soldier and governor of Cochabamba, who polled at 10 percent and 18 percent respectively in the survey.
