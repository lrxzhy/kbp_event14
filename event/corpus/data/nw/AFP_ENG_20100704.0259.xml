US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday she had raised with Azerbaijani authorities the issue of two jailed bloggers whose case has increased concerns over media freedom in the ex-Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that despite "considerable progress" with regards to freedoms in Azerbaijan, "there are still lots of challenges".
</P>
<P>
"President (Barack) Obama and I have both received many letters about the two young bloggers who are in prison. I've certainly raised those in my meetings today," she told a youth roundtable after meeting with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is not only about elections," Clinton said, adding that "new technologies and social media can help the democratic dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The two bloggers, Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli, were arrested and jailed on hooliganism charges last year shortly after posting an Internet video of a donkey giving a press conference, lampooning the country's docile press and statements by government officials.
</P>
<P>
Hajizade, 26, was jailed for two years and Milli, 30, for two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
The charges related to a scuffle in a restaurant but the bloggers and rights groups say the arrests were politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said the charges were unrelated to the bloggers' criticism of the government.
</P>
<P>
International rights groups and media-freedom organisations have repeatedly accused Azerbaijan of curbing free speech by jailing journalists and adopting restrictive media laws.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was visiting the Azerbaijani capital Baku during a whirlwind tour of eastern European and Caucasus region countries. After visiting Ukraine, Poland and Azerbaijan, she was due later Sunday in Armenia and on Monday in Georgia.
