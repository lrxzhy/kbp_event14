CATHERINE E.F. BIDEN, 92, MOTHER OF THE VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
      WASHINGTON -- Catherine Biden, the mother of Vice President Joe
Biden and a presence on the campaign trail with him in 2008, died
Friday at the Biden home in Wilmington, Del. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
      Her death was announced by the vice president. She had become
seriously ill in the last few days, and her son had left Washington
on Thursday to be with her.
</P>
<P>
      Joe Biden often paid tribute to his mother in speeches and in
his 2007 autobiography, "Promises to Keep," lauding her for her
support in his political and personal life (though he noted that
she had expressed reservations when he first discussed going into
politics). In his successful first race for the Senate in 1972,
when he was 30, she organized coffee gatherings.
</P>
<P>
      When Joe Biden sought the Democratic presidential nomination in
2008, Catherine Biden campaigned with him in Iowa before the
caucuses there. She also campaigned with him before the November
election in Scranton, Pa., and at the University of Delaware in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
      Catherine Biden was in the audience when her son accepted the
vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention
in Denver on Aug. 27, 2008.
</P>
<P>
      In his speech, Joe Biden said she had helped and encouraged him
in overcoming his stuttering as a youth, telling him that he
stuttered "because I was so bright, I couldn't get the thoughts
out quickly enough."
</P>
<P>
      After his wife and daughter were killed in an auto accident in
December 1972, Joe Biden said, "She told me, 'Joey, God sends no
cross you cannot bear.' And when I triumphed, she was quick to
remind me it was because of others."
</P>
<P>
      He added: "My mother's creed is the American creed: No one is
better than you. You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to
you."
</P>
<P>
      Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, who was known as Jean, was born on
July 17, 1917, to Ambrose J. Finnegan and Geraldine C. Blewitt of
Scranton, Pa. In 1941 she married Joseph Robinette Biden, who died
in 2002. Joe Biden, the first of their four children, was born in
1942.
</P>
<P>
      While the vice president has described his boyhood in postwar
Scranton as idyllic, in fact his father suffered a number of
business reversals, and for several years when Joe Jr. was young,
the Bidens were forced to move in with his mother's parents.
</P>
<P>
      Besides the vice president, Catherine Biden is survived by her
daughter, Valerie Biden Owens of Kennett Square, Pa.; her two
younger sons, James, of Merion Station, Pa., and Francis, of
Florida; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
