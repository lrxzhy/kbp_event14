TOKYO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of corporate bankruptcies
in Japan increased by 2.5 percent in February compared to the
previous month, according to a report released by the Tokyo Shoko
Research on Monday.

<P>
Compared to the previous year, however, bankruptcies were down
17.2 percent, marking the seventh consecutive month of improving
conditions as the nation looks to recover from dour economic
conditions triggered by a credit crisis that started in the
second half of 2008.

<P>
The companies that went bankrupt last month incurred debts of 439
trillion yen (4.85 billion dollars), significantly lower than the
previous month, when Japan Airlines (JAL) went into
administration. The amount of debt incurred by companies going
bankrupt was also 64.2 percent, smaller than that for the same
month in 2009.

Sectors badly hit in February included building, service and
communications. In February, Japanese wireless carrier Willcom
Inc. declared bankruptcy with debts of 206 billion yen (2.3
billion dollars).

<P>
In recent months the government and Bank of Japan (BOJ) have put
in place a series of measures in an attempt to stimulate growth
and household spending, with varying success.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released earlier on Monday showed the amount of loans
taken out from Japanese institutions was down 1.5 percent from a
year earlier, indicating that despite government measures,
businesses are still over capacity and remain cautious about
future investment.
