IFC signs deal to expand insurance to farmers in East Africa
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- International Finance Corporation
(IFC) has signed agreements with three partners to expand access
to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in
Kenya and Rwanda to help protect their crops, animals and
livelihoods from weather-related risks and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
IFC, through the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF), will
confer grants totaling roughly 4.1 million U. S. dollars to the
Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture/UAP Insurance
weather index insurance initiative in Kenya; the International
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Livestock index insurance
project in northern Kenya; and the MicroEnsure weather index
insurance project in Rwanda.   "These partnerships highlight
IFC's commitment to expanding insurance and other financial
products where they are needed most in Africa. The Global Index
Insurance Facility will facilitate farmers' access to credit,
leading to increased productivity, improved livelihoods and
greater food security," Jean Philippe Prosper, IFC Director for
Eastern and Southern Africa said.   "We are grateful to the
donors that have generously provided funding and to our partners
for supporting this program."
</P>
<P>
The grants, the first three provided under the GIIF program, will
help bring weather-related, index-based insurance to about 35,
000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in East Africa over the
next three years.   "The implementation of these three first GIIF
projects in Kenya and Rwanda will support the development of new
insurance products and will increase expertise in this field,
which will benefit smallholders and livestock keepers affected by
climatic events," he said.  "In addition to the GIIF, the
European Union is providing further financing to the ILRI
Livestock Insurance project in Kenya through the 10th European
Development Fund, Kenya Rural Development Project that will start
in 2011."
</P>
<P>
IFC will confer a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on Syngenta
Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, which expects to help
insure 20,000 farmers in Kenya over the next three years
</P>
<P>
IFC will confer a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the ILRI,
which expects to help insure 5,000 livestock herders in northern
Kenya over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
IFC will confer a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on
MicroEnsure, which expects to insure 15,000 farmers in Rwanda
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
IFC's GIIF program was established in 2009 to assist the
development of index-based insurance for natural disasters and
weather risks in developing countries, where insurance is rarely
available.
</P>
<P>
The grants will fund advisory activities, including local
capacity building, infrastructure development, product
development, and development of local insurance companies'
capacity to provide index-based insurance products.
</P>
<P>
Index-based insurance insures against catastrophic events, such
as wind storms or droughts, depending on their severity.
</P>
<P>
Index-linked insurance products eliminate the need for insurance
companies to individually verify claims, reducing transaction
costs and making it easier for the products and services to be
offered to rural communities and in frontier regions.
</P>
<P>
The European Union committed 24.5 million euros as the first
donor to the GIIF Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
The fund is also supported by Japan's Ministry of Finance with an
initial grant of 2 million dollars, and the Dutch Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, which provided funding to establish the
facility.
