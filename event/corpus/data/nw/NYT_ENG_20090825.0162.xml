THE PLANET, A WEB-HOSTING COMPANY, FINDS ITS OWN ORBIT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
      HOUSTON -- Three years ago, investors bought two stagnant
Web-hosting
companies and merged them into what is now known as The Planet.
</P>
<P>
      They tasked newly appointed CEO Doug Erwin with melding two
different
corporate cultures, turning profits and taking the company public.
Observers say he's done well by hitting two out of three.
</P>
<P>
      "IPOs are not a possibility at the moment" for anyone, said
Dan Golding,
vice president of Tier 1 Research, "so that's not a negative for
them,
necessarily."
</P>
<P>
      "The real value is that they took two firms that had really
sort of
plateaued and put them together successfully. That's a very
difficult
trick to do."
</P>
<P>
      The privately held company won't disclose net income figures but
said
its annual revenue runs about $150 million. When the two companies
merged, they had combined revenues of less than $100 million,
officials
said.
</P>
<P>
      The merger
</P>
<P>
      GI Partners, a California-based private equity firm, bought
Houston's
EV1 Servers whose sister dial-up business Everyones Internet was
sold
off and Dallas-based The Planet separately. It joined the two in
2006,
eventually making Houston the company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
      News of the merger between EV1 and The Planet wasn't greeted by
each
company's employees with much enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
      They were also dealing with new top management, including Erwin.
</P>
<P>
      Employees in each city considered their business practices
better, Erwin
said. So he had employees from Dallas and Houston meet at a
gymnasium in
Crockett for a competition.
</P>
<P>
      He gave each employee 10 toy bricks and told them to build
something.
Whoever built the most creative sculpture would get to pick where
the
piece would sit in the company's new downtown Houston offices.
</P>
<P>
      After discovering they couldn't build much with 10 bricks each,
the
employees formed teams to build a construction zone, a server, a
pyramid
and other sculptures, all of which are on display at the
headquarters in
Bayou Place.
</P>
<P>
      "I told them we were rebuilding the company brick by brick,"
Erwin said.
Some from Dallas ended up winning, "so every time the Houston
folks walk
in, they have to look at it."
</P>
<P>
      New markets
</P>
<P>
      Aside from getting employees to get along, the new management
also had
to make the company profitable and expand it.
</P>
<P>
      First, they used the combined company's buying power to
renegotiate
contracts with everyone from the utility company to Dell, which
provides
all of The Planet's servers.
</P>
<P>
      The company cut costs enough to turn a profit within a year of
the
merger.
</P>
<P>
      Last year it also moved from solely renting servers used to host
Web
sites and run applications to managing the servers for businesses,
competing with companies like San Antonio-based Rackspace Hosting.
</P>
<P>
      Late last year, The Planet entered the cloud storage space
storage
accessed from anywhere via the Web and started renewed efforts to
push
its co-location services, which is essentially renting space in
data
centers for companies that want to locate servers off site.
</P>
<P>
      Today, 50 percent of the company's revenue comes from services
neither
company offered before the merger.
</P>
<P>
      "We've achieved our growth," finance chief Kevin Klausmeyer
said. He
added that the company is targeting small to medium-size
businesses.
Almost half of its customers are overseas.
</P>
<P>
      Growth has slowed since September as the economy declined, he
said, but
the company still managed to secure a $45 million credit line in
October
that it has never used.
</P>
<P>
      But sustaining growth while introducing new products could prove
challenging, Golding said. Last year, for instance, an outage
caused by
a fire at one of its Houston data centers knocked the sites of
about
8,000 customers offline. The company waived monthly fees for its
customers for two months and is trying to recover the lost income,
more
than $3 million, from its insurance company.
</P>
<P>
      "When you're growing at the pace they're growing, you're going
to run
into problems you're never going to see," Golding said. "Your
customers
expect you to execute perfectly. They also need to introduce new
products and hit the cloud computing wave. Doing all that at the
pace
they're growing is tough."
</P>
<P>
      Going public?
</P>
<P>
      Whether the company eventually goes public doesn't matter, Erwin
said.
He's running the company as if it were, he added.
</P>
<P>
      Erwin ran Houston-based blade server company RLX Technologies
with
Klausmeyer before Hewlett-Packard Co. bought it in 2005.
</P>
<P>
      "Whether we go public or not, time will tell," said Erwin.
"But that's
how you add value. I've done this four times before, and we never
made
it to the altar. It always got sold."
