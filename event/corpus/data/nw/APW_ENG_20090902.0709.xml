<P>
The wife and adult children of Taiwan's former president were convicted of perjury and sentenced to prison for lying to investigators in a high-profile corruption case against the ex-leader.
</P>
<P>
The wider case against former President Chen Shui-bian tests the Taiwanese government's resolve to crack down on corruption _ and the credibility of its justice system.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 58, is accused of embezzling $3.15 million during his 2000-2008 presidency from a special presidential fund, receiving bribes worth at least $9 million in connection with a government land deal, and laundering some of the money through Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Chen has pleaded not guilty and claims he is being persecuted for his anti-China views by his successor, Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shu-chen, his wife, was convicted Tuesday of perjury after a Taipei court ruled she asked her children to lie during the Chen investigation. In a statement, the Taipei District Court said Chen's son, daughter and son-in-law each received six-month sentences on perjury charges. All remain free on their own recognizance.
</P>
<P>
A businesswoman, Diana Chen, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for perjury. Prosecutors have accused her of bribing Wu for an executive position in a state-run securities firm, a charge she has denied.
</P>
<P>
Verdicts in the corruption case against Chen and Wu are expected Sept. 11. Prosecutors have said Chen could face life in prison if convicted on all counts, including embezzlement and bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Wu faces lengthy jail terms on bribe-taking and money-laundering charges. She has denied those charges but pleaded guilty to forgery.
</P>
<P>
Chen has been held in a suburban Taipei detention center since last December. Judges have rejected his appeals for release on flight risks.
</P>
<P>
His successor has jettisoned Chen's pro-independence policies and improved relations with Beijing. Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949.
