2nd LD: Former Zambian President Chiluba judged not guilty in
graft case
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's former president Frederick
Chiluba, who had been accused of embezzling 500,000 U.S. dollars
in public funds, was cleared of his corruption charges on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka magistrate's court ruled that Chiluba was of no guilty
of all the 12 charges against him in the case.
</P>
<P>
The trial started early in the morning and lasted for six hours
before the ruling was announced by Judge Jones Chinyama.  Jones
Chinyama said the prosecution team had failed to prove the case
against Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that an important attestor failed to show up
during the trial, adding that "I find that the accused is not
guilty on all counts."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's corruption case closed in March this year and judgment
was set for July 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
But the judgment was last month deferred to August 14 in light of
the consent judgment passed to allow Chiluba file his submissions
out of the court's time.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 14, the case was postponed again to August 17, with the
reason of "the judge is not ready" then.
