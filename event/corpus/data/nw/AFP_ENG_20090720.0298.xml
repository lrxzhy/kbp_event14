<P>
Workers at a bankrupt French car parts factory Monday dropped a threat to blow up the plant unless they get a lay-off settlement from their former clients Renault and Peugeot.
</P>
<P>
Around 100 workers voted to remove a ring of gas canisters from the plant in central-eastern Chatellerault, which they have occupied since their employer New Fabris was declared bankrupt on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The workers were threatening to blow up the factory and its stock of parts on July 31 unless Renault and PSA-Peugeot -- who accounted for 90 percent of their business -- paid 30,000 euros to each of the 366 laid-off employees.
</P>
<P>
Both carmakers have said it is not their responsibility to pay compensation to their supplier's staff.
</P>
<P>
French Industry Minister Christian Estrosi agreed to open talks with a delegation of workers, but only on condition they dropped their threats.
</P>
<P>
The New Fabris threats sparked two copycat incidents last week, as laid-off workers at other firms sought to grab the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
US construction equipment maker Oshkosh agreed to pay extra redundancy money to workers at a French branch, JLG Industries, after they warned they would blow up gas canisters at the plant.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers at telecoms firm Nortel Networks near Paris also briefly threatened to blow up their factory in a dispute over redundancy pay, before backing down the following day.
</P>
<P>
The blast threats follow a wave of "bossnappings" in which French workers took their managers hostage as bargaining chips in negotiations over factory closures.
</P>
<P>
The French government raised the tone over the radical tactics last week, accusing the workers of "blackmail," but stopped short of sending in police.
