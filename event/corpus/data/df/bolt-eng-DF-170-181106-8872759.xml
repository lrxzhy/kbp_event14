Most likely outcome right now is R pick up 100+ House seats and every Senate race.

Pelosi and Reid are willing to accept those losses

Yes I know you HATE the downside of people having health care and the insurance companies having to actually give people care for the money they pay year after year.

The CBO scored this as a money saver you fool.

The only downside is for the Big insurance comapies bottom line and when that sinks into the people you guys are sooooo screwed.

I think that republicans will gain some seats....in 2010.

and I believe the republicans will gain some more seats in 2012....

and I also believe that Obama will be president again in 2012 JUST LIKE president Bush won his reelection in 2004....

I was certain he would have lost his seat as president in 2004, and was sickened beyond sickened when he was reelected.

I think YOU ALL have this to look forward to....

I will quote this after the fact. Lets see how wrong you are. Of course we will lose some seats, but it wont be apocalyptic like you righty's are predicting.

Once again, you will be wrong, just like two Novembers ago, just like recently when you said the health care bill wouldn't be passed. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

The day of the vote I said I had a feeling it would pass, that Nancy would be willing to sacrifice 40% of her House seats to pass ObamaCare today.

His office now retracted the "He was tired" excuse, now they're saying that he did say "Control the people" but when he said "people" he was referring to "insurance companies"

Ain't Fascism wonderful?

Moderates and Jews? Are you saying they are going to vote REpublican now? Dont you thnk the stink of Bush is still way way way too fresh.

You were wrong two novembers ago, you are wrong again. Especially now. Obama is doing an outstanding job, and his momentum is full steam.

Who have you got? Seriously, who?

Palin?
McCain?
Jindal?
Ron Paul?

Who?......................oh please.

Well, they're not going to have a lot of money to do it. Republicans had 22 million, then they received 96 million MORE, add it all together and the grand total is LESS than 10 million.

Where did the money go?

Without the "gimmicks" CBO would have never scored it as a "money saver". Pelosi et al fudged the numbers to get the outcome they wanted and now the CBO admits it.

The downside will be how much this terrible piece of legislation is going to cost Americans.
