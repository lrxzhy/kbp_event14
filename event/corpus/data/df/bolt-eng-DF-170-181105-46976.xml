A guy who presided over the biggest medicare fraud in US history.

It shows you how anti-incumbent the mood is when the public would rather have a guy who presided over a $1.7 billion fraud than a career politician in Bill McCollum.

Really? So there are American voters who would rather vote for a felon, than vote for a Career Politician?

There is no anti-incumbent mood. That is a fallacy. Scott won because McCollum is a very flawed candidate who lost Florida voters' trust and confidence years ago. Scott also, like Meg Whitman and Michael Bloomberg and Jeff Greene and John "I'm not a maverick" McCain, spent over $20 million of his own money. I am on the Panhandle, and I saw Scott commercials constantly and McCollum commercials rarely.

No matter - Alex Sink would have beat either of them, and will be our first female Governor.

Scott's not a felon. He was never charged with anything.

However, the government accused HCA of Medicare fraud when he was the CEO. He was forced to resign and the company settled, paying a $1.7 billion penalty, the largest Medicare fraud settlement in history.

There is no way this guy would ever be hired again to run a large company because he displayed gross incompetence as CEO. So why anyone elect this guy as governor of Florida?

I wanted McCollum to become governor, but now I'm going to have to support Sink. l can't support someone who screwed up so badly.

Correction. He stole billions from Medicare. But that is what Republicans typically vote for. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Rick Scott is a corrupt billionaire who used his money and influence to win the Republican gubernatorial nomination and will attempt to do the same with his campaign for Governor.

His plan is sketchy and is more or less him trying to get into a position of power in government in order to cut corners and further his business interests.

Um, he had to pay a 1.7 billion dollar fine, so I should clarify that he and his companies combined make him worth billions.

And definitely, I agree with the Charlie Crist part. He's corrupt too.

Rick Scott did not pay a $1.7 billion fine. Columbia/HCA paid the fine. Scott was fired, and rightfully so, and he's not fit to be governor, but he was never charged with anything.

i don't know about anywhere else, but here in mass it's not a question of if, but rather when a particular pol will be indicted and subsequently convicted.
