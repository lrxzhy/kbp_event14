Confusedatious:

You are going overboard in your urge to be a dickhead troll, douche boi.

Yeah yeah. She got acquitted. That doesn't mean she didn't actually do it. In fact, it is pretty clear that she did (even if the legal proof beyond a reasonable doubt measure was not achieved).

So don't go trying to hump her leg. She's still a rancid bitch.

There was no actual factual innocence, and baez wouldn't let that bitch near his dick, he knows her all too well, she's a cancer. The very cancer that cost her young precious daughter her life. I think you're dreaming of her playing YOUR organ. Get over it. Pretty sad when you're not even good enough for casey, huh. Loser.

PROBABLE guilt BUT a defense good enough to note the lack of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; Add one Jury that was bound by their oaths = acquittal.

Confusedatious just wants a blow job from the skanky bitch because he finds her attractive and she has some infamy.

That she almost certainly murdered her own little girl is of no importance to a scumbag like Confusedatious.

We all know a jury acquittal means a person is innocent, right? LOL Yeah, and OJ was too.

Why would you post that picture? It only emphasizes the fact this murdered child will never receive justice -and look how her mommy is grinning about that! But THIS is the picture I will always remember of Casey Anthony -dancing in a hot body contest 4 days after her daughter died at her hands, shown here clearly "grief stricken". And PLEASE none of the idiocy about how everyone supposedly grieves differently. NOT TRUE. There is a range of display of emotions that is normal and may be different from person to person but the idea that dancing in a hot body contest is consistent with grief is ludicrous. Otherwise no one would know what the word "grief" even meant, would they? We know what the word "grief" looks like because we also know what is in that normal range. And in spite of every defense attorney since Cain's trying to convince a jury that no one can possibly know what grief looks like (which would make the word meaningless then), grief never looks like this.

THIS is not "grief" of any kind but Casey out celebrating after getting that damned albatross of a kid from around her neck and in the swamp. No justice for this murdered child and mommy can get back out there just in time for the next hot body contest.

Ah, so the horribly confused and thoroughly dishonest bitch troll boi, Confusedatious, is a homophobe AND has now unintentionally acknowledged that his motivation in publicly applauding the cancerous skank, Casey Anthony, is sexually motivated.

By the way, you dishonest nitwit, I wouldn't support this defendant even if (as you clearly do) I found her attractive and fantasized about her sexually. I prefer attractive, intelligent women and ones who don't feel the need to par-tay while their own little girl is "missing."

You are an abomination, Confusedatious.
