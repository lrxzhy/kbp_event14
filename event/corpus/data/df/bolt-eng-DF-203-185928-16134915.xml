it's nice to see someone who is classy (or at least viewed that way), happily married (nothing wrong with single moms, but she's not in a crazy marriage like tom/katie or something) and not being paid to announce it for some tabloid.
i'm happy for her too.

Good for her! But I was sad she got divorced and I was actually a Reese and Jake fan.
