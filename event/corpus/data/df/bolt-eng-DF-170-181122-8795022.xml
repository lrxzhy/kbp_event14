Since her target already passed away at a nice advanced age, maybe the parole now is ok.

Personally, I think certain criminal defendants/convicts deserve to enjoy Club Bars a bit longer. Forever comes to mind.

A: Pick it up, pull out the pin and throw it back!

Technically, the gun was loaded.

She had (for some reason only a Manson Family member might find reasonable) ejected the chambered round before setting out on her insane little mission, but the gun still had (as I understand it) a magazine with four rounds in it.

She apparently pulled the trigger (witnesses heard the click). Empty chambers do not fire. Contrary to what I thought when I first posted this, the other rounds did not get chambered -- apparently because if the one round doesn't fire, the automatic slide action cannot take place so no new round can get chambered.

So the gun WAS loaded, but none of the available rounds were chambered.

And just to be clear, (a) she deserves to spend the rest of her days locked up, and (b) her burial plot should be UNDER the federal penitentiary.

While inside, Fromme tried to escape (a federal felony) and attacked another inmate with a claw hammer.

And those incidents came AFTER the mutant attempted to assassinate the President of the United States.

What does the attempted assassination of a President which comes with a sentence of life -- then another violent felony offense and another serious federal felony get her?

Parole!

Of course.

Yeah, her hair is probably gray now but it was red. That picture of her looks like the girl that carved the backwards B on her face that time. Both crazier than hell...

My favorite sociopath, too.

He's the poster boy for better child welfare and penal reform, in my opinion.
