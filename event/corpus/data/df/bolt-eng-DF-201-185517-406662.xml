hmmm....

he says in your video that OBL has the power to stop this war, yet he says in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/22/wosama122.xml">this article</a> :

<quote>
"My father doesn't have the power to stop the movement at this moment," he said.

He says he wouldn't tell anyone where his father was if he knew, then says Bush should seek OBL out and talk to him directly, to negotiate. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/mazeguyemotions/boggled.gif"/>

He gives the impression that his father, rather than being someone who declared a holy war on "Jews and crusaders" that he has repeatedly prosecuted and says he will continue to prosecute, just made one big boo-boo, for which he's "very sorry."

What bizarre statements. The boy seems confused.

I've often seen the claim that the FBI has not convincingly linked OBL to the 9/11 attacks.

From PrisonPlanet (not intended to provoke knashing of teeth in JREF camp):

<quote>
In late September 2001, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI Rex Tomb told Wired News, "There's going to be a considerable amount of time before anyone associated with the attacks is actually charged."

"To be charged with a crime, this means we have found evidence to confirm our suspicions, and a prosecutor has said we will pursue this case in court."

In June 2006, Muckraker Report investigative reporter Ed Haas contacted the FBI to ask why 9/11 was not specifically mentioned on Bin Laden's wanted page on the FBI website.

Â“The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden's most wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11," he was told Rex Tomb.

These interviews were all given within the last few days.

He doesn't really seem confused to me. He's pretty much defended his father as much as he can without outright advocating his position. He's referred to 9/11 as a strategic mistake, not the horrific terrorist act it was. Frankly, if he wouldn't even be willing to help the authorities find his father, what's the point of even pretending to want peace? Or, like his father, does he only want peace under his own narrow definition of the word?

He can't get any more wanted than he was already. Why keep changing the poster?

I really can not see what the point of this is. The FBI has stated publicly that they hold OBL ultimately responsible for the actions of al-Qaeda, including the 9-11 attacks. He's wanted for capital crimes already. What, exactly, is the line of reasoning that starts with "Osama bin Laden has not specifically been indicted for the 9-11 attacks," and ends up with "The US Government was complicit in the 9-11 attacks"?

Indeed, one would think that if the government was complicit, and this lack of indictment was suspicious, they would just go ahead and indict him for whatever they wanted, change the poster, and leave it at that.

No, he just seems like a son who cares about his dad and doesn't want the blood on his hands for his dad's capture and eventual execution. He very likely has stronger feelings about the actions of al Qaeda and his dad's involvement but is not willing to spark a &amp;#!%-storm over it by stating as much to the press. That's the impression, at least, that I got from him watching the interview.

Of course he was also looking at the very real prospect of living in the middle of Lake Afganistan, the world's largest glowing lake so it's not exactly surprising that he wanted to distance himself for log enough to get out of the way of any missiles pointed in his direction.

An indictment is a type of formal accusation. The FBI have accused Osama and Al Quaeda, they just haven't made it formal.

Make of that what you will, a cost cutting exercise, playing their cards close to their chest or the whim of our secret reptillian overlords.

However to suggest that they haven't got enough evidence to make such an accusation (as some have done) is patently ridiculous when the accusation has been made public and sufficient evidence is in the public domain.

Yes. Probably shouldn't even have distinguished.

Unfortunately, though, I've read from several sources that the majority of Arabs believe the trooth.

I hope one day we can straighten out our foreign policy enough that their distaste for us recedes and they can make rational judgements about us. If I was an Iraqi it would probably be very easy to convince me of the trooth. Their thinking must be that we've inflicted hundreds of 9/11's on them so why wouldn't we do it to ourselves?

There's a lot of the world that's willing to believe the worst about this administration, but to put them on the same level as conspiracy theorists who knowingly and wantonly reinterpret things their own way is a gross miscalculation of culture. "Bush probably did it" (a paraphrase of the most common sentiment) is a far cry away from the types of claims that Jones and company here in the states tend to make.

I'd say that you should have distinguished better.

There's a lot of the world that's willing to believe the worst about this administration, but to put them on the same level as conspiracy theorists who knowingly and wantonly reinterpret things their own way is a gross miscalculation of culture. "Bush probably did it" (a paraphrase of the most common sentiment) is a far cry away from the types of claims that Jones and company here in the states tend to make.

Ok, you're probably right. In fact, the former's numbers are probably greatly bolstered by the latter, making the works of Griffin, Jones (both), Avery, et al especially evil IMO.

It seems to me, that if the government pulled of 9/11 and blamed it on Osama... they'd have no trouble indicting him to cover their butts.
Seeing as they're not trying to cover themselves though, there's no reason to indict him again as he is already wanted for capital crimes.
The FBI did raise the reward on Osama Bin Laden significantly after 9/11.

I find the whole "FBI hasn't indicted bin Laden for 9/11"... "anomaly"... to be rather amusing. It's like the truthers are accusing the FBI of being truthers, on a number of levels...

1) "We know he's responsible! We just don't have the evidence!"
2) "We don't actually believe he, or Al Qaeda, were responsible for 9/11, therefore we fundamentally, yet quietly, disagree with the Bush administration."

Stupid, definitely. Chock full of ingorant mental onanism, absolutely. I try to reserve the designation of 'evil' for people who actually manage to have a significant effect (for the worse) on humanity, though. Other than that, I'd agree. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

You mean like when UBL came out after 9/11 and said he wasn't behind 9/11 but debunkers ignore that fact?

No, we don't ignore his first statement. We recognize it for what it was: an attempt to prevent the U.S. from punishing the Taliban. Unlike conspiracy liars, we also don't ignore all of his subsequent statements explaining his role in the attacks.

You're not doing very well here.

This is what Osama bin Laden said after 9/11:

<quote>
I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation.

That is something that Osama bin Laden could say today. It is true. Osama bin Laden did not carry out the 9/11 attacks. The 19 people he picked out for the mission did so, under the control of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who bin Laden help assure funding for.

Osama didn't carry out the attacks. His "denial" is a crafty composition of weasel words, meant to prevent the U.S from punishing the Taliban (as Ron just said). Of course the people who executed the attacks had their own motivation. It just happened to be a motivation that Osama bin Laden shared with them, one that he exploited to see his ends accomplished.

His denial amounts to no denial at all, and his statements of confession are far more simply stated.

We'll have to disagree on that. I believe these guys at the top - meaning Meyssan, the Joneses, Griffin, Avery, Bermas, et al - are, perhaps unlike the average trooth footsoldier, intentionally creating and spreading lies for personal profit and to the detriment of truth and civil discourse. That to me fits perfectly with Merriam-Webster's first definition of evil: morally reprehensible.
