Just a few minutes ago the parliment elected a new President.

After the Somali president resigned last month, Ironically the Transfederal government has voted the leader of the UIC (Union of Islamic Courts) and ARS as the new President of Somalia. <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

Congratz to Sheikh Sharif, As a Somali i'm very happy, this means hope, peace and a way forward to rebuild the country.

You will see this all over the news in the next hour or so.

My point exactly. Somalia can't afford to be picky, so if the islamists can actually bring some order into the country, then all hail them.

However, if Somalia hadn't been in such a pickle as it is, then perhaps some demands on freedom of speech, etc would have been suitable.

No one can argue that the west is more advanced and less corrupt than Somalia and the middle-east. But this is because no country has fully apprehended the Islamic laws. If there was a country with 100% Sharia then I would definitely move to that country.

It's quite hard to consider yourself as an Islamic state. For one the country has to apprehend all laws and have no mixture of other laws within it. The country also has to have enough wealth to stop starvation/poverty within other countries. Somalia has no strong army (therefore America could just attack it whenever they want) and has no natural resources (and thus it cannot have a good economic stability). The state has to established within a country such as Egypt,Turkey,Pakistan etc.

Relatively speaking; there are plenty of islamic theocracies that fail to fulfil that criteria. I'm really not sure how being 'America-proof' is a defining quality of an islamic state.

It was founded through the army. The army and the kings or monarchs are seperate powers. So the army was convinced by Mohamed and thus the rulers were taken off their throne. And of course citizens were also convinced of this (which made it easier to establish; no rebellion)I assume that's the only way it can be established in modern time.

No, I'm safe to say that not a single country apprehends all laws. Perhaps they exemplify capital punishment but they don't for instance instigate the law that every hungry person should fed etc. Saudi Arabia also has aspects of Democracy/Capitalism which clearly abolish the assumption that it's an Islamic state.

Well it would be best to have a strong army which can defend it's own people. Being 'America proof' (and all other countries) is a way of defending your citizens.

Perhaps you're right. But we know the tensions America has with middle-eastern countries. Since Irak Gaza Afghanistan, and many other countries have experienced unnessesary torments it's only natural to have an army which can prevent future wars/attacks. Iceland unlike Irak doesn't provide one of the largest quanitities of oil, so Iceland is quite useless (no offence).

It's entirely irrelevant. My point was that Somalia having no resources was a good thing, because resources are bad for development. I don't understand what point you're arguing?

Somalia is a hole and should leap at the opportunity to have any form of government. Hopefully the extremists won't get hold though, the place is one of their breeding grounds as it is.

A lot of states say they are Islamic when they are in fact not. Cambodia called itself a workers paradise when it clearly was anything but. For a state to truly abide by the Shari'a (which, as a system has become clogged up with centuries of cultural junk that has to be cleared out) it has to have all the nice things as well the bad. The punishment for theft only makes sense if everyone is well fed and no one wants.

Also, the treatment of women in nearly every "Islamic" state is completely against the teachings of the Qur'an and prophet. Despite what you hear, many Muslims in more enlightened nations are sick to the core with what is being committed in the name of our religion. Orthodox Islam needs a dose of the twentieth century to shake of fourteen centuries of cultural rubbish and get back to the basic teachings of the Qur'an.

Excuse me? What in Africa can even be compared to the massive bloodshed in Europe in 1914-1918 and 1939-1945? These two conflicts resulted in more than 50 million Europeans lives lost in a total of 10 years of fighting. On top of that our infrastructures and economies were reduced to sheer rubble by 1945. Britain, for example, was completely bankrupt.

Does this mean we've regressed into some quasi-anarchy with non-existent economies? No.

Sure, you Africans suffered too. 10 million Africans were taken in chains to the Americas, over three centuries. Yet it's not even close to 50 million dead in a total of 10 years of fighting.

Point is, get over yourselves and accept some responsibility.

I disagree.

You don't need to have 'wealth' to be an Islamic state, nor does it need have an army or natural resources (there's no Islamic requirement for it either). You do what you can with what you have...and establishing Shariaa law for example like the UIC did in Mogadishu in 2006 doesn't really cost much.

I'm glad he won. He did alot when the UIC were in power and hopefully he'll do well for the rest of Somalia. But I really hope that he sorts out the rift with Al-Shabab asap before that rift ends up causing more havoc.

Let's take the scenario of Somalia being the first Islamic state since 1924(?). Could Somalia provide food and shelter for other countries let alone their own? It is compulsory to do this and in order to do this you will have to be quite resourceful I believe. And I'll get more information on the army part.

They do what they can for their country and anyone else. Somalia for starters is worse off than the majority of countries out there and lets be honest, not many would actually head to Somalia for a better life.

The country's responsibility as an Islamic state would be to aid every needy they can, Somali or otherwise. But in Somalia, everyone is Somali simply due the chaos it's been in. So essentially, yes...they'll be helping the needy Somalis (which is majority of the population at this point).

Again, you do what you can. It isn't an Islamic requirement to be 'wealthy or resourceful' to be an Islamic state...naturally it would help, but not a necessity. The same way that as individual Muslims you are required to help your Muslim brothers to the best of your ability...regardless of your wealth...if someone is worse off than you, you do what you can to help, and that help can come in any form.

Hah, obviously Africa and Europe has (or had) quite some differences, yet one must face the fact that Europe in 1945 was rubble, literally rubble. Especially Germany. Yet what happened to West Germany after the war? They rebuilt their country, and grew into a leading industrial nation. This, even though they lost a staggering 10% of their population, MANY of these men between 18 and 35, who were the backbone of the economy.

I obviously wouldn't have expected Africa to experience a boom similar to this, yet I WOULD have expected them to atleast move out of square one. Yet have they? No. Most African nations are in the same, or worse, position now as 50 years ago. But still it's all our fault, isn't it? We messed it up, remember(!!!), so we're responsible for their failures for ever and ever!

Having researched it I must agree with you on the 'wealth' part. Although you do have to have a strong army in order to be the first Islamic state. This is because of two reasons: rationality and through text. Rationally the state must be able to support itself in early stages and texually we know by the book of Ibn Kathir that the prophet rejected weak tribes offer for power. But yes Somalia, Bahrain and Mauritius could an Islamic state but cannot be the start point.

That's still not an indication not set-up an Islamic state. Rejecting weak tribes does not mean that they didn't rule by Shariaa in all their affairs. Keep in mind also, that Shariaa law as described today was essentially laid out during the entire period of revelation.

Not setting up an Islamic state or rather ruling by man-made laws as opposed to Allah(swt)'s laws is outright kufr in Islam (one of the nullifiers of Islam and see verse 5:44). Now having said that, Somalia and it's gov. has two options...rule by Shariaa or commit kufr. Harsh but true.

Ignorance is not an excuse for making stupid comments. It doesn't hurt to ask a question if you don't know the answer. I did ask a question in this thread too.

Africa along with many other developing parts of the world are moving ahead briskly in terms of economic growth while the Western world is mired in recession, facing financial crunch and economic collapse. Almost every hour (not day) one hears/read/watches some company, some firms, financial institution collapsing, defaulting, going bankrupt and making huge losses.

It's the real future of the West unfolding, I hope. Africa is not one country, nor one economy. It has thousands of ethnic groups, varied topography, various genetic features for its inhabitants and various levels of development although none of its richest/most developed countries compare with the richest/most advanced in the world, it has similar levels of malnourishment as India which is highly praised in Anglo media as it's propped up to be a counter to the real rising powerhouse - the Dragon i.e. China.

That argument should hold true for India too yet the Anglo media doesn't propagate that theory nor do you when it comes to India. China has been growing faster than India for at least a few decades, yet it has been richer too. How could that happen?

No, how ludicrious. How about we use every single factor that has or is differenting Europe from the rest of the World? Whiteness, for example. It must be the colour of our skins which make us superior!
</quote>

Are you pretending to be dumb or is it just your natural self? Who said Europe is superior in anything? Granted, in perversions like homosexuality, paedophilia, incest, bestiality, alcoholism, drug abuse, abortions, gang violence and so on, Europe/West may lead the world; Europe doesn't lead in many other aspects.

The colonies were an economy loss. What is it that does not penetrate into your brain? If they were an economy loss, then how the **** did they make us superior? Revolutionary spear technology?
</quote>

Which MORON said colonies were economic loss for europe? If so why did they retain them at all? Look at the captured gold and silver from latin america, the gold rush in americas, plenty of slaves to steal and enslave from africa and what not. Don't act like a moron as I'd like to believe you are not one.

How do you explain Scandinavia? None of the Scandinavian countries have had colonies, yet they're arguably the most prosperous.
</quote>

Scandinavians were associated with the same lots who were the biggest colonisers. How do you explain that Iceland crumbled due to a few accounting and finance tricks carried out in some remote place? Is that how Scandinavia is most prosperous? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lol.gif" alt=":lol:"/>

You are wrong though, Luxembourg isn't in scandinavia and it's the richest country because many foreign workers who commute aren't counted in official statistics. Qatar is then the naturally richest country of the world which isn't Scandinavian.

Ever heard of a loan? Most businesses take these when they're starting up or expanding. This means that they buy stuff USING THE LOAN-MONEY. Do you think countries are self-sufficient? All nations import various things, and all nations export other things. We call this 'trade' <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/eek3.gif" alt=":eek3:"/>.

Example: I'm gonna set up an international finance firm. I borrow some money, buy an office, employ some people. I then sell my services to people abroad, thus injecting money into my national economy. I pay my employees and pay of my debt. Export of a service rather than goods.

Get it? SERVICES are EXPORTED. MATERIALS are IMPORTED. Do I need to make myself clearer? Is there something which you wish me to shed more light on? Just ask and I'll answer.

P.S It wasn't your example?

So the nonwestern world only produces 20% of global output? Who is being daft here? Try to correct your mistakes before I splash facts on your face that make you cry. And dont cry afterwards.

In economic terms, yes we do. We produce the most wealth, and consumes the most wealth. See GDP per capita. Seriously, shape up or I cannot be bothered.

That argument should hold true for India too yet the Anglo media doesn't propagate that theory nor do you when it comes to India. China has been growing faster than India for at least a few decades, yet it has been richer too. How could that happen?

Without population growth in the first place, how do you explain a country merely 2 centuries old filled with 300 million persons? We're talking of the largest Western country here. So you are right that without population growth western world would have been in deep trouble as they are now.
</quote>

But not all economies grow at the same speed. China started out with a similar GDP per capita to India in the '70, but has grow to the size it is today. It's not that hard to understand.

The Western World doesn't grow nearly as fast as the developing world. Is this really news to you? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>. Compare the 3.24% growth rate in Congo with the 0.3% growth rate in the UK. Much of the eonomic growth in these developing countries is caused by an increase in the labour force.

Read, please.

The rapes of indigenous peoples happened centuries ago, yet how come most Europeans were poor until at least the early 20th century? All this captured gold and silver was spent on wars and extravagance by the kings, and not a single penny went to the people.

Slavery was a small part of the American economy, and only a percent or so owned slaves at the time of the ACW. The economy was rather based around the industries in the North. Slavery was an inefficient practise for many decades before the civil war, though.

Iceland crumbled due to the fact that it is a tiny nation with a tiny population, which betted its state finances on the stockmarket. Thus it easily collapsed as a small nation has a harder time holding itself together than a large one.

Still, half-arsed excuses. Iceland has fallend and we 'associated with the same lots'. Come up with something real, please.

Oh, you found a couple of nations with higher GDP per capita? A tiny nation of bankers and a country with an economy based rather solely on oil? Oh, okay.

However, what I said wasn't that the Scandinavians are the most successful or wealthy, but rather amongst them.

Come again.

If services are exported by A to B, the same service is imported by B from A. Why are you bickering over terminology anyway? What relevance is there to the thread topic or our discussion?

That's because of the aforementioned reason(s).

</quote>

What a load of b*llocks!

Japan produces more than twice as much as UK in every sector imaginable. The nonwestern world includes all of Asia, much of eastern europe, latin america, and africa. That accounts for around 50% of global output.

Take a look at IMF ( a western institution)'s figures.

Why does it take you so long to understand that then? And that the largest democracy in the world that anglowestern media so hypes up is actually trailing far behind a supposedly oppressive, backward, insular economic system, that of China?

The reason is most of that talk is tripe excreted through western media outlets and their mouthpieces.

So you know that the Western world is in decline? Good for you. You are wrong about the source of growth in developing countries. There is marked standard of living improvements caused by consumption rise, caused by productivity rise due to rise in level of education, investment and peace/prosperity.

Europe was to that day the most savage continent and through the various atrocities it committed (the list is too long to mention here) it only furthered its claim to that 'throne' (of most savage and backward region).

The rapes of indigenous peoples happened centuries ago, yet how come most Europeans were poor until at least the early 20th century? All this captured gold and silver was spent on wars and extravagance by the kings, and not a single penny went to the people.

So you admit at last that Europe only got rich through exploitation.

Slavery was a small part of the American economy, and only a percent or so owned slaves at the time of the ACW. The economy was rather based around the industries in the North. Slavery was an inefficient practise for many decades before the civil war, though.

OK. Notwithstanding that the entire USA 'economy' was based on stealing and exploiting resources of the natives.

I don't see you making any points except trying to circumvent the gist of the thread's arguments by going around in circles around irrelevant issues by sometimes using childish expressions and at other times not even reading the reply well.

BTW Qatar is the richest nation on earth if you exclude tiny Luxembourg which excludes foreigners who commute daily from its statistics. And Qatar is not one of the biggest oil exporters around either. You are wrong there too.

Your ignorance is amusing for the moment, don't know how long that will last.
