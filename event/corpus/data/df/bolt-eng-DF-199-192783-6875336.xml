That is true of every state. So why did the cancellations really occur?Because Republican Party bosses did not want Bush to be embarrassed by evidence of Republican opposition.

As it turns out, the concern was well founded. In several states that held Republican primaries this year, significant numbers of GOP voters rejected Bush.

In New Hampshire, for instance, 22 percent of citizens who selected Republican presidential primary ballots voted for someone other than Bush. (More than 3,000 New Hampshire Republican primary voters wrote in the name of Democrat John Kerry.) In Rhode Island, more than 15 percent of Republican primary voters rejected Bush. In Idaho and Oklahoma, more than 10 percent of Republicans cast Anyone-But-Bush votes, while almost 10 percent did so in Massachusetts. Even in the president's home state of Texas, more than 50,000 Republican primary voters refused to back Bush.

Despite the convention show that Republican leaders will put on in New York next month, Bush has inspired a good deal of grumbling among the faithful. The results from a number of the states that actually held Republican primaries reflect that embarrassing fact. There are no embarrassing results from states that canceled Republican primaries - which, of course, was the point of the cancellations.

No wonder so many Americans got scared when Bush appointees started talking about plans to cancel the November elections. Perhaps they have come to the conclusion, based on all those canceled primaries, that this administration and its minions believe democracy is a tidier enterprise when the voters are excluded.

Interesting article, Redheat. The thing is, when it comes to the actual election, do you feel that Republicans will be so swayed to vote for Kerry? Or, will they back him in the belief of 'it's better to vote a Republican dolt than to vote for Kerry?' They may want anyone but Bush, but that does not essentially mean that that 'anyone' could be a Democrat.

True but I think the point being made is more about the preventing of voting rather then who they want to vote for. Could be republicans would have written McCain. Who knows but they didn't get the chance to choose.

Ohio republicans today got a slap in the face when the secretary of state halted the plan to use Diebold elction machines this November. This thwarts the promise of Diebold Chairman whose name I forget to "deliver Ohio's electoral votes for Bush."

Ohio republicans are now going back to the drawing boards facing the specter of an honest election this year.
Why the hell should we have to work under these conditions." a right wing poll taker was heard to say. "Aren't we under enough of a disadvantage having a modern day Simple Simon as our nominee? Now they tell us we can't cheat."

The article is crap, it takes a very low number of non incumbant votes in the primaries, which is fairly common, then runs off the deep end with conjecture.

Bush won the primaries where held, primaries that are pointless are a waste of money that many states don't want to spend right now.

Nothing to see here but desperate liberals trying to spin anything and everything to help their state of denial.

John Nichols is full of crap. First of all, why did he neglect to mention that several states haven't had primaries for years? What were the Democrats hiding in Iowa and Washington when they held their cacuses?

He also neglected to mention that the shift to dropping primaries is a result of states going to an open primary system where anyone can vote in either party's primary (which 29 states now have) and that there were efforts in the states he listed to have Democrats vote in the Republican primaries in those states and vote against Bush??????

USA today ran a story right after the NH Primaries mentioning that almost 8,000 people that had voted for McCain in the 2000 primaries found that they were registered as Republicans when they showed up at the polls even though they were in fact, Democrats.

Inconvenient to your proposition, Redheat, at least from my point of view, is that overall primary voter turnout this cycle is among the lowest on record. Interesting to note is that Democratic primary turnout has lagged behind Republican turnout in several states, even the likes of touted Democratic stronghold <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=734561&amp;highlight=turnout#734561">New Jersey</a>. In states holding primaries for both parties, <a href="http://www.fec.gov">The FEC</a> shows overall Democratic turnout, as percentage-of-registered-voters-by-party-affiliation almost uniformly has been tracking behind Republican turnout as compared to previous primaries. A number of Mainstream news articles have noted this. Given that it is not unusual for a state party, as an economic consideration, to not hold a primary when that party's candidate is an incumbent without inter-party challenge... why undertake the expense to present a contest in which the outcome is a foregone conclusion... it is clear the reason for cancelled Republican primaries is simply lack of reason to hold a primary.

Timberlandko-the democratic nomination was won by Kerry in early March after a string of primary wins, often with record breaking turnout. The righties enjoy pointing out, as you did, the low voter turnout in NJ and other states. You conveniently fail to point out that in many cases, the primaries took place well after Kerry became the presumptive nominee, so, what is the point.

Democrats have rallied to Kerry as evidenced by his recent fundraising which has outstripped even Bush's. Kerry was not my first or second choice. But, I support him enthusiastically as do millions of other democrats, independents and even a few republicans. He is currently ahead in enough states to go over the 270 EV threshhold needed to win. So, despite your theory to the contrary, low voter turnout in some states is a non-issue. You will see record turnout in November and that is bad news for the repubs and good news for John Kerry, the likely next president.

Howdy, Sagamore, don't think I've seen you around here before. Welcome to A2K, hope to see more of you.

I'll submit I "conveniently fail to point out" the spin. Claiming low turnout has been a function of Kerry's dominance ignores the facts. Perhaps you missed this, from before Kerry's lock on the nomination:

That all seems to be good news for the dems-moreover, these numbers are generally running away from Bush. It is he that has the mountain to climb. This election is Kerry's to lose.

By the way, thanks for the article which essentially confirms my point: Dems showed up in force when the nomination was on the line, then faded once it was over.

No, the Democrats didn't. Sorry that is one of those urban legends that is not based in actual fact. There is actual fact that Republicans weren't allowed to vote in primaries. Fact is in FL (which is what I'm sure you think you are referring to) Military ballots over 1,000 I believe WERE COUNTED even though they were illegal.

Once again you guys try to pull the "well you did it" line to excuse the party who claims to be "above it" I just wish you would decide which side your on. If the Democrats supposdly do it then its ok for you to do it? Is that what you're saying? So then if you are going with this don't pretend to be better because it makes you just the same now doesn't it?

See I believe not allowing Americans to vote be they (R) or (D) is WRONG. period. No excuses, no " but they did it first" just plain old WRONG. I guess some Republicans don't think that way even when it's their own. Which goes to show that Republicans support Bush FIRST and Democracy second.

pathetic

Once again you are full of crap. Tell me, how many Democrats voted in the Iowa, Michigan, Idaho, Maine, Deleware, New Mexico, Hawaii, Minnesota, DC and Washington Primaries? The fact is the grand total of votes cast in the Democratic primaries for all of those states combined is a big fat ZERO!

Fishin' is attempting to muddy the waters of discussion with a trick question. His intent, no doubt, was to point out that no democrats voted in the primaries of the states listed. Fishin' knows that he has listed the caucus states, who do not have a primary election per se. They opt to selct their delegates through the caucus process and not through direct election as one would do in a primary state. Nice try but as transparent as glass. I don't even see your point, though.

The list Fishin gave us is incorrect in part. Delaware did have a primary on 2.3.04 which kerry won with 50.4% of the vote. DC also had a primary.

The point is that most of the states that dropped Republican primaries held caucuses instead and since Democrats have traditionally had more caucus states than Republicans have, their bitching about it now and crying about how it's an attempt to hide dissent is a typical pot calling the kettle black.

Since that is exactly what the author of the original piece and Redheat are doing it's directly on point in the dicsussion and since at least 3 of the 5 states that moved to the caucus system the decision to make the change was made by legislatures controlled by Democrats so they can hardly cry that it's a Republican ploy to hide dissent.

Well, to throw a little common sense into this, the dems had several candidates in the primaries, a republican primary would have resulted in Bush, the republican incumbant, being chosen without any doubt.
SO what reason was there to have a primary?

None, of course, it would have just been a waste of resources.

In '68 Humphrey received the Democratic nomination while having won a grand total of no primaries. Unopposed, other than by fringer Lyndon LaRouche, in '96, Clinton essentially did not participate in the primary process, never formally declaring himself a candidate. In 1980, 34 states held Democratic primaries, while in '84, there were 30 such contests, in '88 there were 37, '92 saw an all-time high of 40, and in '96 there were 35 Democratic primaries.

"After Chicago, and Humphrey's subsequent defeat in the general election, the impetus for change was, if anything, stronger and broader based" (Bartles, 1988, pg. 20). After 1968, Democrats formed a commission to recommend reforms in how they chose their nominee. It was unofficially called the McGovern-Fraser Committee. Among the Committee proposals eventually adopted were that all states adopt primary/caucus rules (some had none), make times and dates available to the public, choose delegates during the convention year, ending the winner-take all primary, and ending various forms of discrimination (DiClerico and Uslaner, 1984, pg. 9-16). Some of these reforms were also adopted by the Republican party because "many Democratically controlled legislatures...instituted presidential primaries for their states that were in many cases to be conducted for both parties" (Haskell, 1996, pg. 28). There was a sharp increase in the number of state presidential primaries in the aftermath of 1968, but a national primary was not one of the reforms adopted, not surprisingly because "most members of the McGovern-Fraser Commission...favored a reformed convention rather than establishment of regional or national primaries" (Davis, 1980, pg. 244). Perhaps the best chance to adopt a national primary, since its inception, was lost.

After the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, the schedule changes every presidential election as other states jockey to increase their influence over the candidate selection process by holding their caucuses or primaries at different times. As a result, the overall presidential primary schedule is not usually known for certain until just a few months before the primary elections begin.

1996 there were just as many Republican primaries.

Fact is timberlake from what I've been able to gather either states had a Primary or a caucus, I found NO evidence of a state having neither as has been done for Bush.

For the '04 cycle, Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Washington all cited cost concerns and/or questions as to the relevance of the excersize in light of Kerry's unassailable frontrunner status as reasons for cancelling or considering the cancelling of their scheduled primaries. North Carolina cancelled her scheduled February primaries due to failure of redistricting, replacing them with caucauses, as, citing declining primary election turnout, did New Mexico.

By Andrew Buttaro

Facing record deficits, several states have decided to cancel their presidential primaries for 2004. The states claim that they cannot afford the elections in a time of fiscal austerity, saying that increasingly late primaries are becoming irrelevant.

Many political observers have said this nascent trend is unsurprising, as the primary system is in disarray and dire need of reform. Opponents of the current system argue that the primaries are front-loaded, meaning that the leading candidate is chosen by campaign donors after the first few primaries, and the rest are ineffectual formalities...

I further submit the notion the GOP, or The Democrats, would choose to abjure participation in a primary contest as a means to stifle inter-party dissent is patently absurd. Your mileage may vary, and I'm sure it does. I contend cost/benefit is the sole deciding consideration in any choice of whether or not to hold a primary election.
