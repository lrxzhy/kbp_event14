But in the Justice Department's eyes -- and anecdotally those of T-Mobile's customer base as well -- the costs of the merger may outweigh the benefits. "The combination of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products for mobile wireless services," said deputy attorney general James M. Cole in the Justice filing.

Monopoly? Puhleeze. As I understand it, T-Mobile is the #4 wireless provider, and AT&amp;T is #2. For those of us who can count, that means there's a #1 and a #3, at least. Hardly a monopoly, and hardly likely to allow a merged company to start hiking prices and blowing off the need for technological advances.

And that's completely leaving aside the fact that there's no way to HAVE a monopoly in a market like the US without government intervention. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

Their history as far as customer service shows they have been relaxing already.
I just renewed with T-Mobile, but as I'm always a good shopper and love to look up stuff, I did some heavy research. There were alot of negatives about AT&amp;T, the best thing that they have got going is their sheer size.
Also the MORE competition, the better it is for the customer. As a former buyer for a large entity, I found the more choices I had for my dollars the better the prices and customer service I got. It's a no-brainer. And you, as a consumer benefit from wide open competition.

First of all, it's quite easy to have a monopoly in certain industries without government intervention. They're not called natural monopolies for their nice green color.

Second, it's The Sherman Anti-Trust act, not the Sherman Anti-Monopoly act. A business doesn't have to be a monopoly to run afoul of the law.

Does the federal government have the Constitutional authority to intercede on behalf of Sprint?

Sprint urges the United States government to block this anti-competitive acquisition, said Vonya McCann, Sprints senior vice president for government affairs. This transaction will harm consumers and harm competition at a time when this country can least afford it.

Shares in Sprint have fallen more than 5.5 percent since AT&amp;T announced its deal last week, trading at $4.77 late on Monday afternoon.

Rhetorical question. I know the Constitution (1787) was abolished.

T-Mobile is struggling, at&amp; t has committed to adding 5000 jobs and investing 4 billion in infrastructure to bring them both up to parity and snuff.

You do know that T Mobile is owned by Deutsche Telekom right? And that they have stopped spending for the last 2 years in capital expenditures for T Mobile and keep it competitive? They gave up on it.

T-Mobile cant afford to keep up with the 4th generation of wireless technology. So the merger makes perfect sense if you want to save the jobs as T-Mobile has admitted they cant afford the upgrade to their system. And that means T-Mobile will be put out of business by the competition which is no different than being taken over by ATT except for the fact that ALL the jobs will be gone. ATT even promised to keep all the customer service jobs here in the US and even bring back any that are overseas.

Dumb move in our current economy if you ask me.

I use T-Mobile and had to call Customer Service last night. They routed me to a call centere in the Philippines, (I could tell because the girl had a distinct Visayan accent. Don't ask how I know what a Visayan accent sounds like.)

So, really, what's the difference between what soulless corporations is running your phone. As long as I get my call to go through, I'm fine with it.

T-Mobile cant afford to keep up with the 4th generation of wireless technology. So the merger makes perfect sense if you want to save the jobs as T-Mobile has admitted they cant afford the upgrade to their system. And that means T-Mobile will be put out of business by the competition which is no different than being taken over by ATT except for the fact that ALL the jobs will be gone. ATT even promised to keep all the customer service jobs here in the US and even bring back any that are overseas.

Dumb move in our current economy if you ask me.

Well, that's good. (See my previous post about the Filipina Customer Service Babe).

I work for a company that is in the wireless industry, and yes, this is a good move for T-Mobile. It isn't a hostile takeover, both sides want it. And T-Mobile customers will benefit from gettin access to all AT&amp;T's resources...

I agree and my opinion isnt partisan based. The govt said they were concerned about costs going up. I just dont see that happening. I ditched ATT for Sprint for cost savings last year and low and behold now ATT is advertising a lower price now for an everything +unlimited data plan. Competition should keep the prices in check. Not to mention here in KC their are a lot of MOM N POP style opperations offering very cheap services.

Monopoly? Puhleeze. As I understand it, T-Mobile is the #4 wireless provider, and AT&amp;T is #2. For those of us who can count, that means there's a #1 and a #3, at least. Hardly a monopoly, and hardly likely to allow a merged company to start hiking prices and blowing off the need for technological advances.

And that's completely leaving aside the fact that there's no way to HAVE a monopoly in a market like the US without government intervention. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

You hit the nail on the head. They keep crying about a monopoly. It doesnt matter either way as T-Mobile is going under. The only question is do we want to try to save the jobs or let them go. The monopoly argument is moot beause either way T-Mobile wont be around much longer.

Don't complain to me about outsourcing and sending JOBS overseas--YOU FREAKING MORONS.

You hit the nail on the head. They keep crying about a monopoly. It doesnt matter either way as T-Mobile is going under. The only question is do we want to try to save the jobs or let them go. The monopoly argument is moot beause either way T-Mobile wont be around much longer.

SAVE THE DAMN JOBS FOR CHRISTS SAKE.

Two big communications deals, MCI's proposed takeover of Sprint in 1999 and EchoStar Communications Corp's deal to buy Hughes Electronic Corp's DirecTV in 2001 fell apart after the Justice Department challenged the deals.

"A preliminary question is whether AT&amp;T will go to court. It's certainly not uncommon for companies to look at this and decide that the game isn't worth the gamble," said David Smutny, an antitrust lawyer with Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe.

But in the Justice Department's eyes -- and anecdotally those of T-Mobile's customer base as well -- the costs of the merger may outweigh the benefits.

Monopoly? Puhleeze. As I understand it, T-Mobile is the #4 wireless provider, and AT&amp;T is #2. For those of us who can count, that means there's a #1 and a #3, at least. Hardly a monopoly, and hardly likely to allow a merged company to start hiking prices and blowing off the need for technological advances.

And that's completely leaving aside the fact that there's no way to HAVE a monopoly in a market like the US without government intervention. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

They're afraid that by allowing this merger, there will only be two viable companies left. Sprint is about to go the way of Pontiac, Saturn, and Oldsmobile.

T-Mobile and Sprint use two different technologies. T-Mobile uses GSM [SIM cards] and Sprint uses CDMA. I'd think that would prevent them from merging.

First of all, it's quite easy to have a monopoly in certain industries without government intervention. They're not called natural monopolies for their nice green color.

Second, it's The Sherman Anti-Trust act, not the Sherman Anti-Monopoly act. A business doesn't have to be a monopoly to run afoul of the law.

The Department of Justice vs. AT&amp;T

Peter Suderman | August 31, 2011

It would also give AT&amp;T access to the scarce wireless spectrum that T-Mobile currently ownsspectrum that's currently difficult to acquire thanks to federal rules that end up creating artificial scarcity. That additional spectrum would likely substantially hasten AT&amp;T's ability to roll out faster data networks. Obviously there's no gaurantee that the deal would mean better service for customers, but the upside, if it works, seems reasonably clear: More robust service, and a faster network.

Naturally, Obama's Department of Justice has filed an antitrust lawsuit intended to block AT&amp;T's acquisition on the grounds that if the two companies merged, consumers would suffer.

The news was unexpectedAT&amp;T officials claim they were given no noticebut it's not exactly surprising given the current administration's aggressive stance toward Internet providers, and wireless carriers in particular. Under President Obama, the Federal Communications Commission not only spent considerable time and effort passing net neutrality regulations, it's also begun paving the way for increased regulation of the wireless sector.

Monopoly? Puhleeze. As I understand it, T-Mobile is the #4 wireless provider, and AT&amp;T is #2. For those of us who can count, that means there's a #1 and a #3, at least. Hardly a monopoly, and hardly likely to allow a merged company to start hiking prices and blowing off the need for technological advances.

And that's completely leaving aside the fact that there's no way to HAVE a monopoly in a market like the US without government intervention. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

Duectch Telecom is pretty brutal when it comes to non performing overseas assets. They also owned DHL, which they tried to sell. When the sale didn't go through, they just closed down the operation over the period of a week.

Wonder what Insiders make killings on futures trading KNOWING how the JD would come down on this merger?

I'll bet the SEC does, too.

Of course thanks to the lack of owership transparency, the SEC will probably never know.

AT&amp;T has one of the worst customer service rating in US, where as T-Mobile has one of the best. As a T-Mobile customer, I want T-Moble to be T-Mobile.
Also, in a capitalistic economy, competition is good and favors the consumer.

</quote>

In a capitalistic economy, the capitalism ensures competition, not the government. And there certainly IS competition. Just because AT&amp;T merges with T-Mobile doesn't mean they get to just relax and do whatever they want.

</quote>

Their history as far as customer service shows they have been relaxing already.
I just renewed with T-Mobile, but as I'm always a good shopper and love to look up stuff, I did some heavy research. There were alot of negatives about AT&amp;T, the best thing that they have got going is their sheer size.
Also the MORE competition, the better it is for the customer. As a former buyer for a large entity, I found the more choices I had for my dollars the better the prices and customer service I got. It's a no-brainer. And you, as a consumer benefit from wide open competition.

</quote>

I hate to break it to you, Sparky, but your personal experience with and opinion of AT&amp;T's customer service is NOT the universal objective standard by which all citizens of the US will now be judging. While I do not currently have a contract with AT&amp;T, I did for many years, and was always quite pleased and satisfied with their customer service. I switched to T-Mobile for a better price when my teenager became old enough to need a phone, and have actually been not quite as happy, although certainly not UNhappy, with their customer service.

Also, while competition is good for consumers, that really only applies to NATURAL competition, arising from free market forces, not forced competition generated and manipulated by government intervention. This merger would not mean that there was no longer competition in the wireless market, nor would it prevent some newcomer from arising and biting AT&amp;T's butt if they're ever dumb enough to start resting on their laurels.

I'm not saying I'm for or against the merger. I'm saying the free market doesn't require government interference, manipulation, and micro-management.

First of all, it's quite easy to have a monopoly in certain industries without government intervention. They're not called natural monopolies for their nice green color.

Second, it's The Sherman Anti-Trust act, not the Sherman Anti-Monopoly act. A business doesn't have to be a monopoly to run afoul of the law.

<quote>
But in the Justice Department's eyes -- and anecdotally those of T-Mobile's customer base as well -- the costs of the merger may outweigh the benefits. "The combination of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products for mobile wireless services," said deputy attorney general James M. Cole in the Justice filing.

They're afraid that by allowing this merger, there will only be two viable companies left. Sprint is about to go the way of Pontiac, Saturn, and Oldsmobile. What the government might allow however is a T-Mobile/Sprint merger. That would only be of lasting benefit if T-Mobile had controlling power though. Sprint is such a mess right now, if they had controlling power in a merger, they would just bring everything down.

</quote>

Why does anyone believe the government is so brilliant that it can and should singlehandedly decide who should and should not survive in the marketplace, and in what form? Capitalism does NOT work by the government artificially creating competition and interfering with natural market forces. All it can really accomplish is to shortsightedly hamper and retard economic movement.

I have tried to not put on partisan glasses on this issue but the fact that the left in this thread is so anti merger I have no choice. The company (ALONG WITH THE JOBS) will go under without a merger. I see NO LOGICAL REASON to be in favor of disallowing the merger other than to support the Obama administration.

I tried damn hard to avoid making that accusation but have been left no choice. It proves the point many have made that some of you will follow Obama straight off a cliff.

You claimed that the concern here was about monopoly. it wasn't. The law being enforced doesn't deal only with monopolies.

</quote>

I guess YOU'RE not that smart. Casually tossing out a term and going, "See?" as though that just settles the whole argument by itself is not meaningful. It is vague and unresponsive. If you still don't understand this, have someone else try to explain it to you, because I don't find you interesting enough to dig any further trying to get something real out of you.

I addressed monopolies specifically, dumbass, because the poster I was responding to - who, I believe, was not you - specifically mentioned them, not because I "claimed the concern was" JUST about monopolies.

Coming into an ongoing conversation that didn't include you and trying to reset the parameters is ALSO meaningless, vague, and useless.

So now that I've done everything but draw you a picture in Crayolas with bright, primary colors, see if you can produce a post that's worth something, rather than coming back with another version of, "You didn't praise my brilliance; you're obviously stupid and just didn't understand." I understand what you're saying all too well; that's exactly why I think it's such a giant, reeking pile of nothing.

We're not talking about quality control regulations, shitstain, so see if you can possibly manage to stick to one fucking topic for longer than a minute. I realize how hard it is with that toddler-level attention span, but give it a shot.

We're talking about the government telling the private sector who they can do business with, and what kind of business they can do, and who can buy what. It's no more appropriate for the government to tell AT&amp;T what floundering companies it can and can't buy than it is for them to tell me which brand of toilet paper I can stock up on.

Although being a big liberal zit on the ass of life, you probably think the government SHOULD decide between Charmin and Northern for people.

</quote>

Microsoft doesn't have a monopoly, and never has had one.

Operating system: Linux
Server: Linux
Desktop applications: Apple, Corel, Google, IBM, Novell, Oracle, etc.
Online services: AOL, Google, Yahoo, etc.
Entertainment: Nintendo and Sony

Is there one big company that does all of these things and competes with Microsoft? No, but there doesn't need to be for effective competition to exist and benefit consumers, as it in fact does. Indeed, in some of these areas, Microsoft gets quite soundly and routinely trashed.

That's the point. People talk about "monopolies" and how they "control market share", but the truth is that without government intervention, NO business "controls" anything. All they can do is HAVE the market share... for the moment. It is all too easy for a monolithic titan of business to make one misstep and disappear forever, to be replaced by a swarm of newcomers. Go ask Montgomery Ward and the A&amp;P if you don't believe it.

I didn't say it "fostered" anything, so perhaps the person who can't read is the REAL retarded one here. I said that there is still lots of other competition out there, which there is. Furthermore, the government stepping in and saying, "No, T-Mobile has to continue to operate independently" doesn't "foster" competition, either, since they're apparently ready to go under on their own, or they wouldn't be considering the sale at all. What does forcing them to go out of business accomplish?

That about sums it up.

Of course the fact that the Chinese can make toothpaste so cheaply, thanks to the fact that their people are so poor, plays a role in this, too.

Easily fixed problem though.

Microsoft was never a monopoly.

FYI, the government alleged that Microsoft used anti competitive tactics by including features in its OS that other companies were trying to charge people for. They were also accused of forcing manufacturers who wanted to use Microsoft products from offering other computers with products from other companies that sold operating systems.

They were trying to stifle competition in some ways, but they were never a monopoly. Now they get the government to help them maintain their market share by forcing companies that a completely free (to them) OS to pay them for the patents they infringe on by using something that no one sells commercially.

Do you honestly want to try to use them as an example of something the government did right?

No, the problem is that we have unreasonable standards, but the chinese have no standards. So companies (like the one I work for) just find it easier to move my JOB (not me) to China. But I've got standards, man. That's the important thing!

As for the toothpaste, the toothpaste ends up here, anyway. Usually in a dollar store.

I think I'd rather have a job than unreasonable standards like "You didn't properly document your forklift training, so we are going to hit you with a $50,000 fine."

We're not talking about quality control regulations, shitstain, so see if you can possibly manage to stick to one fucking topic for longer than a minute. I realize how hard it is with that toddler-level attention span, but give it a shot.

We're talking about the government telling the private sector who they can do business with, and what kind of business they can do, and who can buy what. It's no more appropriate for the government to tell AT&amp;T what floundering companies it can and can't buy than it is for them to tell me which brand of toilet paper I can stock up on.

Although being a big liberal zit on the ass of life, you probably think the government SHOULD decide between Charmin and Northern for people.

Well no government is telling the private sector they cant merge and own 100% of the market. We dont allow these things most of the time because it hurts capitalism.

See the best way our market works is if you have plenty to choose from. This would kill choice and the free market for the private sector. You get one step closer to these people controlling the rates and nobody else can do shit about it.

Let me guess? You live in a town with one Pharmacy, Restaurant and one gas station right?
Now the local eat and poop might be the only thing around for miles, and they charge 10 bucks for a soda, but hey its all good right? They are the private sector an therefore can do what they like!

I was right, you are fucking stupid. Let me guess you are one of those people who get drunk off mouth wash right?

How would this kill choice? The FCC estimates that most Americans have access to at least 5 different cell providers.

Microsoft doesn't have a monopoly, and never has had one.

Operating system: Linux
Server: Linux
Desktop applications: Apple, Corel, Google, IBM, Novell, Oracle, etc.
Online services: AOL, Google, Yahoo, etc.
Entertainment: Nintendo and Sony

Is there one big company that does all of these things and competes with Microsoft? No, but there doesn't need to be for effective competition to exist and benefit consumers, as it in fact does. Indeed, in some of these areas, Microsoft gets quite soundly and routinely trashed.

That's the point. People talk about "monopolies" and how they "control market share", but the truth is that without government intervention, NO business "controls" anything. All they can do is HAVE the market share... for the moment. It is all too easy for a monolithic titan of business to make one misstep and disappear forever, to be replaced by a swarm of newcomers. Go ask Montgomery Ward and the A&amp;P if you don't believe it.

Microsoft was never a monopoly.

FYI, the government alleged that Microsoft used anti competitive tactics by including features in its OS that other companies were trying to charge people for. They were also accused of forcing manufacturers who wanted to use Microsoft products from offering other computers with products from other companies that sold operating systems.

They were trying to stifle competition in some ways, but they were never a monopoly. Now they get the government to help them maintain their market share by forcing companies that a completely free (to them) OS to pay them for the patents they infringe on by using something that no one sells commercially.

Do you honestly want to try to use them as an example of something the government did right?

I think there is an important issue that Microsoft became kind of close to a monopoly because the market demanded it.

I write up a spreadsheet on Excel. I send it out to ten vendors. One is using Lotus 1-2-3. Another is using Gnumeric. Another is using Visicalc. The market demanded everyone use the same software..

</quote>

Demanding that everyone use the same software isn't the same as demanding that not only should everyone use the same piece of software for a given task - but ALL software should be written by ONE entity.

That's kinda like communism - 'cept the people don't own it.

The fact that Windows is such a shitty operating system is proof enough that the market is often WRONG. I haven't used an anti-virus software in almost a decade and haven't gotten a single virus. - BECAUSE I DON'T RUN WINDOWS - and any time I have to boot up a Windows system for whatever reason - at work or helping a friend or family member with their computer - I get a little panic attack just thinking about how long I'm going to sit their waiting... waiting... waiting....

I find the Government's position on this baffling, especially since T-Mobile wants the merger just as bad as AT&amp;T does.

I should point out that when I called T-Mobile the other night, I spent five minutes getting shunted through computers before I talked to some customer service babe in the Philippines. So I'm not seeing what the supposed jobs issue here is.

One joke I heard was that it would be horrible if the merger meant we got AT&amp;T's coverage and T-Mobile's customer service out of the deal.

In the 30 years since they did us this big favor and broke up AT&amp;T's monopoly, we've seen these fly by night phone companies come and go, people invested and lost their shirts, and land lines are slowly being replaced by wireless networks. But soon it will be down to just Verizon and AT&amp;T.

They are number 2 and T mobile is a sliding fast no.4. The feds said the merger would "enhance AT&amp;T's market power", uhm yes thank you Captain Obvious, thats whjy most co's merge, to leverage up.

The question is, does it skew the field or harm competition? No, it doesn't and the FCC didn't even attmept to make that case really.

Half the reason we are even discussing this is becasue bandwidth is scare and a spectrum allocation/re-allocation auction has been a 'need to do' for a decade, BUT the feds cannot get their act together and just get it done.

Just wait till they get their hands into the Net....unreal.

Absolutely unreal! Here's the ironic part. AT&amp;T even offered to move 5000 jobs back to the US that have been offshored by T-Mobile. T-Mobile is owned by a German company that wants to get out of the American Market.

I've had T-Mobile for several years. The coverage is better than friends get with AT&amp;T.

i'm sorry america has standards..If you dont like our standards feel free to move to china.
Just dont complain when you get sick from the toothpaste

</quote>

No, the problem is that we have unreasonable standards, but the chinese have no standards. So companies (like the one I work for) just find it easier to move my JOB (not me) to China. But I've got standards, man. That's the important thing!

As for the toothpaste, the toothpaste ends up here, anyway. Usually in a dollar store.

I think I'd rather have a job than unreasonable standards like "You didn't properly document your forklift training, so we are going to hit you with a $50,000 fine."

till that forklift goes nuts, cuts off your arm and you sue.

Then some dipshit, atheist government bureaucrat will demand an exorcism be performed on said forklift.........

Also, in a capitalistic economy, competition is good and favors the consumer.

I agree. Then again, in a capitalist society isn't the government supposed to stay out of the affairs of private business? I'm always torn about things like this. What is the criteria that the government uses to make these kinds of decisions?
