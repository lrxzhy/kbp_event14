This is all of the details so far. Stay tuned. This is Cardon, OH. just east of Cleveland. This is per 640 WHLO News in Akron.

â€Ž4 Life Flight helicopters are on their way to Chardon. 3 victims are reportedly in critical condition, 1 stable.

UPDATE: <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/232710/396/Report-of-shooting-at-Chardon-High-School">http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/232710/396/Report-of-shooting-at-Chardon-High-School</a>

Reports say that police have contained both shooters.

UPDATE: FBI says there are 5 Chardon victims.

6. You're right: there's only a 90% chance it's an unstable teen.

It could also be an unstable father going
through a bad divorce.

But the odds are pretty low that it's a PTA

Mr. Letcher, that kinda-weird boys' gym teacher.

42. Ding, Ding, Ding

We have a winner. Lack of mental health services and addiction services are the biggest factor in many of these violent acts. Think of all of the notorious cases and how the criminal is almost always mentally ill. The most recent 20 years of decreasing violence in the US has been attributed by many to access to abortion services. I believe the next move in once again starting a rapid decline in violent crime is access to mental health services for anyone at any time.

18. In the past, school shootings where much more common..

BUT, they where not widely reported.

In the age of the 24 hr news cycle, if it bleeds it leads, and for weeks and weeks, this shooting will be in the news, even though it seems that no one was killed (as of press time). Their was many violent acts in the past, in schools that where not widely reported. In on instance Andrew Kehoe a school official, spent days, packing the crawl spaces of a school with explosives and blew the school sky high, and killed some more people after the blast with a car bomb...

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster</a>

Our memories are very short when it comes to school killings. And statistically today, their is far less killings in our schools than even 20 years ago.

BTW, I NEVER said, any school shootings where ok, Stop making things up...

24. no, you never said that school shootings are okay.

you just said "actually, there are less today than in the past" - what was your purpose in offering that information? (to which i would like to see some specifics, some proof)

are you asserting that violent acts such as what happened today were not reported in the past? i don't believe that. thanks to the internet more people may be getting the news, but stories such as this were always news.

sure, violence has always happened, but i don't see it lessening. in the past (only) 5 years, TWO shootings with fatalities just on ONE CAMPUS (VT), just as an example off the top of my head. another poster in a related thread stated that this is the second school shooting in a very short time span just within the area of CLEVELAND.

the subtext of jumping into this particular thread with your "good news" is, in my opinion, your way of saying, nothing to see here. but there is lots to see when people are, over and over, deliberately going out and murdering or attempting to murder multiple people in one place at one time.

we need to get a handle on the violence in our society, and offering that it used to be worse just does not cut it. it's BAD. very, very BAD.

41. In post #2

the poster implied some sort of new upsurge. Seems the poster was replying with his belief that there are not more than ever now. The poster didn't support their comment with statistics, he needs none to counter that claim.

Every time something like this happens there are people running around with their hair afire screaming how there is some sort of epidemic of school shootings when there really isn't.

we need to get a handle on the violence in our society, and offering that it used to be worse just does not cut it. it's BAD. very, very BAD.

OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, GOD, GOD!!1!!1

Violent crime in the US has been on a 20 year decline. You feel free to cite anecdotal cases if you please, but nobody has ever said shit don't happen, just that actual violent crime stats indicate a long term decline in violent crime, including shootings.

Any suggestions just how to accomplish this, or just more OH MY GOD!1!

Access (easy and cheap) to mental health services and addiction services might be a good start, IMHO.

50. Solutions come from truth, not perception

Nobody likes these things, and there are options to reduce them. People die unjustly every day in every way and always will. If we act to reduce these incidents, the numbers of actual victims will be reduced..statistical data is the key to truth. The statistical data compiled by the DOJ indicate a long period of decline in violent crime.

26. Please provide statistical data

I am not claiming you are incorrect - I don't claim to know how many school shootings there were twenty years ago, much less when I was in HS in the 60's. I would simply like to see the data going back, say, 50 years. I don't consider 20 years long enough, since the years since then have seem the victory of the 1% crushing the poor and working class via outsourcing/off - shoring/dismantling the safety net/union busting/etc. And twenty years ago we were well into the disintegration of our cities for the poor and working class, as well as the decline of unions. So, twenty years is not far back enough. Thank you.

65. True. We can also see though that within the decade of the '00's

there was a year with 38 deaths - which surpasses three of the years in the '90's. (The '90's were horrific - when I say I don't remember how many, I am talking about not remembering the exact number, not about how awful the number was. My "emotional memory" of them is very strong, as my dtr was in HS in those years.)

And the Wiki article seems to have no summary data for the '60's or before - actually, I think for the 80's or before. And since we are, I think, talking about student-on-student shootings when we discuss "school shootings" the earlier list have many incidences include things like jealous spouse comes to school to shoot spouse" that would have to be eliminated.

The 90's were, as I said, horrific,, and the 80's not much better. My interest in seeing the data beyond the past twenty years arises from a number of factors, but among them the question of whether or not when we talk about "less now" we are talking about merely a return to what we in US might consider a "normal" number of school shootings, ie, a number similar to that in eras prior to the 80's-90's? Or, if the #s in the 90's were actually "normal" given the earlier decades, which would make a lower trend now far more significant, it seems to me, than if we are merely returning to an appalling "norm."

I am no statistician - just an interested observer. However, I do not think that mere lists of numbers, perhaps not even compiled using the exact same criteria, is very useful.

21. I'm certainly not a gun nut

But you can't blame a gun for violence in this case. It takes two to tango. A gun needs to bought (stolen), loaded, and fired by a human. Obviously there is a very sick human behind this. How did that person fall through the cracks? What kinds of parents are there (or not there?)

I agree that guns are readily available and not much is done to keep them out of people's hands who are unstable. However, this goes deeper than just a gun problem. We have a people problem.

My money says someone's dad wasn't very careful with his guns. Time we start punishing folks like that and those that sell them privately without background checks. Background checks need to be beefed up as well.

There are no more new automatic weapons for US Citizens. Only weapons registered and sold before 1986.

35. Tragic all around. Off topic, but WHLO is one of FOUR Limbaugh stations in Cleveland

Both HLO Akron and WTAM Cleveland play Rush live. Why can't one of these stations at least broadcast Thom Hartmann (currently tape delayed on the new <a href="http://talk1460.com">Talk 1460</a> ). There isa also WKBN from Youngstown. (At least KBN's morning host Mike Romigh is a liberal!) Oh yeah Cleveland can also hear Rush on Detroit's WJR "the HATE voice of the Great Lakes".

Geez that's what a deregulated radio marketplace without obligation of public interest does: monopolies that cause ubiquity of bloviators. In my area I can hear FOUR stations playing Lamebaugh live (one local, three out of area). Why does TAM get to call itself "Newsradio" when its schedule is mostly Republicon propaganda? How could a place that elected Dennis Kucinich have so many RW knuckleheads on radio?

And before the pro NRA trolls start calling on students and teachers to be armed: truth is, when a student starts gunning down a campus, if everyone else had a gun, there would be Wild West type chaos and even MORE harm to peoples' lives.

WHLO was a powerhouse rock station for years in the 1960s and 1970s. They had huge ratings. Then sometime in the 80's it went all religion. Clear Channel bought them and made it into an almost 24/7 conservative station. The morning News program is not right wing. I had actually seen the Facebook Breaking News report from WHLO and that's how I saw the original news of this shooting.

He also had David Icke as someone who inspires him. I think that is the big "Illuminati' guy that kids are into these days. Very weird stuff.

Kids are into the Illuminati these days?

63. There was also a possible David Icke link in the Gaby Giffords shooting

I've just checked a couple of DU threads about it, and apparently the basis was that a guy from the SPLC who was interviewed by Keith Olbermann said that Jared Loughner's obsession with "conscious dreaming" appears to come out of Icke's stuff.

I don't know if that was ever confirmed, but it would be interesting if there was an Icke connection to both of them.

I guess thinking many of the people around you are lizard-folk in disguise could make running amok with a gun seem like a plausible course of action.

66. Labeling people as "other" reduces the moral reasons not to kill

If they are not "one of us" and aren't even human, the various societal prohibitions against murder and assassination are less likely to stop an unstable person.

I believe that is one reason there is such a move to define Obama as "other". Sure, the top GOP people doing this aren't really telling their followers that it is OK to go out and kill him, so if some person with serious problems decides to do it, they can deny any involvement.

Think about Jared Loughner - the reports have been that he was not really political and that the shooting was not politically motivated. I wonder how often the right wing talking heads in Arizona made claims about Rep. Giffords that framed her as "other" and so let Loughner get to the point that in his disturbed mind it was OK to shoot her.

54. Any thought of what could have driven this kid to do this?

Could be bullying....he actually may have been the victim yesterday.

58. As is often the case, the information coming out may not be completely reliable at this point

I would suggest everyone take a deep breath and not to leap to any assumptions about anything. Case in point: its being reported that the student that died is named Daniel Parmenter. That may well be true, but I can't be the only to find it passing strange that the name of one of the victims in the shootings that occurred in February 2008 at Northern Illinois University also was Daniel Parmenter.

In addition, I have seen reports that the photos that are being posted of "TJ Lane" holding a couple of guns are not photos of the TJ Lane identified as the shooter. Maybe it will turn out that they are, maybe not. My point is that its unwise to accept without question all of the information being reported at this point.
