Did Obama Save GM?
GM Profit Rises to $1.54 Billion on Auto Sales Gains
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-08-12/gm-profit-rises-to-1-54-billion-on-auto-sales-gains.html">GM Profit Rises to $1.54 Billion on Auto Sales Gains - BusinessWeek</a>

For the longest time we have been subjected to wild rants about Obama 'taking over' GM. Socialism on the march!

Now it looks like GM is on the road to becoming a profitable private entity again -- thanks to Obama.

Does Obama get credit?

Last year GM was shutting down plants when they filed Chapter 11, said Wall, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This summer, most of its U.S. plants were running full out.

btw, is the above quote an example of the new generation of editors being dumbed down? who is 'Wall'?

Did GM need saving?

Ford seems to be doing just fine, even better than GM, and they didn't take a dime...

How's Chrysler doing? Didn't they take government money? Why does no one ever mention Chrysler?

Allow me to answer in this way:

1) Did GM need saving?

Not all questions are valid when put into a broader context like, what was being said a year ago about the future of GM and the American Automotive Industry.

2) Ford seems to be doing just fine, even better than GM, and they didn't take a dime...

Did Ford need assistance? Where they in trouble -- in danger of going out of business?

3) How's Chrysler doing? Didn't they take government money?

Is Chrysler doing badly? Obama threw them a lifeline. Were they in such bad shape the money didn't help? Did the titans of industry run Chrysler into the ground?

---

Then there is this nugget of wingnuttery:

?) Why does no one ever mention Chrysler?

No one ever mentions Chrysler? What's the matter, is FOX News boycotting Chrysler?

Sure he can have the credit. What is going to happen with the over $900,000,000 which is the government's share? Also how much was the amount the of the bail out? Has the government broken even yet? How much of the debt was forgiven? (When you file for bankruptcy you usually do not have to pay everyone back the full amout.) Are we as a country going to benefit from this? How much of the profit was from cash for clunkers? If we take away those numbers does it still look good? There are a lot of numbers missing here.

obama shouldn't get credit for shit. 60% of G M, G overnment Motors is still owned by the government, which bailed them out with TAX PAYERS MONEY. They should have been left alone to fail. They should have gone through with the bankruptcy, reorganized, broke the death grip the unions had on them, and reemerged as a new, stream lined, better organized, leaner, meaner company with NO DEBT TO ANYONE.

Fuck obama, and all these moronic bail outs.

I'm not sure why you would consider me a "wingnut" for asking a question but okay...

You know, some times businesses fail. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they fail and then come back. But, in my opinion, it is not the responsibility of the government to bail them out, no matter what their size. I was opposed the auto bailouts now, I was opposed to the Chrysler bailout of 1980, and I was opposed to the Bush bank bailout.

Oh, and I don't watch Fox News, well, except for Red Eye.

so you take from my post that I considered the act of asking a question to be itself, wingnutty? hmmm, you are close to being dismissed. It should be obvious what I meant.

On the questions of bailouts, it isn't matter of bailing out a company. That is a specious and deceptive framing of the issue. The question is allowing or preventing a collapse of an entire industry.

Nations have policies for trade and economics. It is the role of governments to ensure a healthy environment and more. How government does this is open to argument. Arguing that government has no role is an exercise in philosophical masturbation.

Thank you for not answering one single question. HMMMMM Their are much much more businesses that do not depend on their very existence. Instead of assuming you know what I am talking about let me tell you. I want to know how much money was used to bail out GM and if that was included in the profit margin. I want to know if the cash for clunkers was a factor in the profit. (If it was a lot of government money was used to make a government business profitable.) Being profitable is relevant to the numbers you use. I would like to see those numbers.

Lets not forget the shareholders and folks who had money invested in GM. The folks with 401's and retirement invested. You know. The folks who got hosed when the Govt took over GM. Are they gonna get their money back??

The real winners at GM were the Unions. Payback is great ain't it???

I understand. The devil is in then details, but arguing over the process and ignoring the end result is an exercise in mental masturbation.

Whether or not industries rely on some or much government assistance is not the issue. Industries have a-l-w-a-y-s relied on government assistance. Always.

Now, for their very existence? That is another question, but using here is disingenuous at best. Maybe ignorant? Depending on government for ones very survival in times of trouble is as American as Apple Pie.

Are you talking about Arab owned Fox News?

Just as Steven Emerson believes that American universities using Saudi mega-money (often from Alwaleed) to set up Islamic studies departments should register as Saudi agents, I believe an American television outlet part-owned and part-influenced by the Saudi prince should, too.

<a href="http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2010/02/09/opinion/doc4b70ebb097853325026342.txt">Fox News Channel unbalanced by Saudi influence- The New Haven Register - Serving New Haven, Connecticut</a>

$27 million to the families of Palestinian aka suicide bombers.

Arabs should focus more on penetrating U.S. public opinion as a means to influencing decision-making

How ironic that this same bad guy is now a News Corp. blood-money bags, a boss who must be handled with care as, for example, Fox News Channel host Neil Cavuto did in a deferential interview with him last month.

How does this influence the outlets coverage? Its impossible to say. Alwaleed has bragged that it only took a phone call to ensure that Fox News Channel coverage of Muslim rioting in France not be described as Muslim rioting, a boast News Corp. has never denied.

This month, security analyst Joseph Trento, in light of recent negotiations between Alwaleed and Murdoch, mused online whether his own recent interview on Fox &amp; Friends didnt appear in the channels online video cache because he had told host Steve Ducey that Saudi Arabian money was still financing al-Qaida.

If I were going to bring down a country from within, I would attack everything the president did, and say anything to get the people riled up and hating their own country and then sit back and watch them tear each other up.

No arguing over the details in the case is not unwarranted. The profits are being stated but it is currently a government owned company. If the government invests 2 billion dollars into the company that is not counted as a debit and it makes 1.5 billion in profit then the government lost 1.1 billion dollars and the numbers are skewed. It is not a success that it is being paraded around as. Now if the company made 1.5 billion dollars in addition to the bailout and all debts then it is the success that we are seeing.

Your argument about accepting government help in times of trouble doe not mean you are a successful business. It means you are needing help to survive. It is also not my idea of America. I was not brought up to accept handouts from the government when times were tough. I was taught to tighten my belt and look for a way out.

the purpose of the government helping out GM is siad to be part of an attempt by Obama and his socialist allies to take over America and make us a commie nation.

but even taking all your fears into consideration, the main idea about turning GM around is NOT to make a profit -- it is to make the company profitable enough to go private and reenter the market on it's own.

how that is done is irrelevant to many of us. We just want the industry saved. We care about keeping more people from ending up homeless and hungry and without jobs.

Not everyone thinks the takeover of GM was a move towards communism. Some of us just think the government has no business bailing out a failing company with taxpayer dollars to begin with.

There's zero reason why GM couldn't have kept it a private matter, filed bankruptcy, and emerged with a new business plan.

It's not like something like that has never been done before.

He helped but we did it, all Americans who support American workers and American business. Our Buick is a beaut.

=================================

Join me Labor day weekend - get this out to the workers here in America.

I was riding home today after a middle distance bicycle ride, tired and a bit out of shape when I started counting cars, America - foreign, American - foreign. It occurred to me if only a small percentage of these people, the people who can afford more than a used clunker, bought American there would be no problems in one of our largest industries today. And lots of people would have a job and lots of businesses would be OK. May even help those incompetent bankers.

So I started giving thumbs up for American and thumbs down for foreign. Hard to distinguish which foreign car is made here, but no need I am a bit of a hard core American when it comes to cars. My '55' Chevy was my first love.

I'm sure the people thought me spastic, as my left hand thumb pointed up, then down, then up as cars drove by. Did anyone figure it out I wondered. Who is this nut! So if the whiners who lost the election can out of the blue, protest taxes, can we not protest something that has been going on for years due to cheaper prices, support structures, and no pensions, but still is having an insidious affect on our industrial base?

So if you own foreign go to you nearest mirror and give yourself a thumbs down and if you own American and thus support all of us and America, a thumbs up is due and thank you. Take to the streets and express yourself. The bankers thank you too.

Oh, and my bicycle is made in America too.

the purpose of the government helping out GM is siad to be part of an attempt by Obama and his socialist allies to take over America and make us a commie nation.

Not everyone thinks the takeover of GM was a move towards communism. Some of us just think the government has no business bailing out a failing company with taxpayer dollars to begin with.

There's zero reason why GM couldn't have kept it a private matter, filed bankruptcy, and emerged with a new business plan.

It's not like something like that has never been done before.

All you really got out of the bailout was a quick fix, which still remains to be seen, that our grandchildren have to foot the bill for.

I think it was more about saving an industry than bailing out any one company, and governments have a-l-w-a-y-s subsidized and made policy favorable to national industries,

if you believe there were zero reason why GM couldn't or shouldn't have gone the route they did, you are either being disingenuous or you are ignorant of the arguments a few years ago as the economy was unraveling at a frightening rate.

For the remainder of 2010, Chrysler is projecting to at least break-even as it starts to sell the new Jeep in volume and brings a number of new and revised products to showrooms after a long drought. The revamped Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 will be joined by the Fiat 500 by the end of this year, and several other vehicles get major interior upgrades. Depending on how things go in the current quarter, Chrysler says it expects to probably bump up its projections for the second half of the year.

dante must consider two things:

1. bush is the one who gave them the huge initial bailout money. i know this really hurts dante, but he must accept facts at some point in his life and stop trying to give obama all the credit and bush all the blame.

2. it is way, way too early to even proclaim they are saved. if they are saved, let's talk in a couple of years and see if they pull a chrysler from the 80's. handing a company billions of dollars might see a temporary gain, but only time will tell if they pull out.

i still think they should have been allowed to fail.

You know, some times businesses fail. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they fail and then come back.

<quote>
The government is offering a $7,500 tax credit to people who purchase the Chevy Volt. So that takes the $41,000 sticker price down to $33,500. But wait just a minute..... doesn't the government own GM? Why don't they just make the sticker price $33,500? It's obvious why they are going the tax credit route.

GM gets to puff up their sales figures and bottom line whenever they sell a Volt. They will show the full $41,000 sales price on their income statement, and also book the additional $7,500 as proft, (above and beyond what they are making if they sold it at $33,500). The federal government will eat the $7,500 in the form of issuing additional debt that we and our kids will all owe. This is phoney accounting! GM and the federal government are all one entity!

Did Obama Save GM?
GM Profit Rises to $1.54 Billion on Auto Sales Gains

For the longest time we have been subjected to wild rants about Obama 'taking over' GM. Socialism on the march!

Now it looks like GM is on the road to becoming a profitable private entity again -- thanks to Obama.

Does Obama get credit?

---

Last year GM was shutting down plants when they filed Chapter 11, said Wall, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This summer, most of its U.S. plants were running full out.

btw, is the above quote an example of the new generation of editors being dumbed down? who is 'Wall'?
</quote>
That was funny, thanks for the laugh.

The problem GM had before the bailout, the rising costs of union pensions and health care, still exist unchanged. If Obama had not "saved" GM they would have gone through a real bankruptcy proceeding, been able to divest themselves of the bloat of those contracts, would not have cheating people who invested real money in the physical assets of GM out of their money, and would be moving toward a profit that did not come from fancy bookkeeping and government subsidies.

Did Obama save GM? Only in the dreams of the liberals and unions who think that being saved means making money off of taxpayers instead of earnings.

Take a look at how a real auto company faces a major problem.

<quote>
GM might have earned $1.3 billion during the April-June period, but thats half as much as crosstown rival Ford Motor, which may have more than three times as much debt but also has a longer track record as a profitable automaker.

As GM reports continued momentum in its turnaround, its important to keep its mind the long, painful roads both took to improve.

Since 2005, Ford and GM closed plants, eliminated or sold brands and reduced dealerships.

While GM restructured with federal assistance, and now has the U.S. Treasury as a 61% owner, Ford took out a $23 billion loan in 2006, giving it the cash cushion necessary to be the only domestic automaker to survive 2009 without filing for bankruptcy.

Now, both are profitable again for the first time since 2007. But Ford is widely regarded as further along in its recovery.

It's not fair, nor is it right or their job to bail anyone out with tax payer money. End of story.

If Bush or Obama and the people in congress really thought "bailing" GM out was the way to go and that there would be a good return on their money, then they should have taken millions of their own money and invested it.

As I said, you more than any republican voter support the "evil corporation." All it took as a guy telling you it's imporatant that has a D next to their name.

It is a weird thing. Inflation is happening all the time now, your dollar is becoming worth less every single day. The fact that Obama has taken the stimulus and not spent around half of it is odd because literally everyday that money is worth less. And of course the inflation a trillion dollars adds to the economy makes your money worth less.

On top of it all Obama used to stimulus that he did spend to help keep costs for many things artificially high, again making your money worth less.

If things fell apart, if things were allowed to come down then people’s jobs and peoples saving would be worth much more, because they could buy more with it, or invest. For instance, if GM decided to go out of business, someone could have come up with a business plan and found investors… In the long run the new company would have had to be innovative, create a better product through quality and style to sell to the public. Instead we get a buy out and see nearly the exact same product being sold.

It’s basic logic, it’s happened millions of times throughout history… Government “helping” a company out only holds us back as a people.

The price of a hose could have gone from 600,000 to 125,000… Instead Obama and congress (even Bush yes) have tried their hardest to keep homes sales artificially high. A 600,000 % home can go for 400,000 in many areas. Sure the price coming down 200,000 is a lot but it really needed to come doe around 400,000 to be more inline with what is affordable to the general public.

Correct, but you see under a fair system you are allowed to invest your own money into a company if you really feel it's so awesome. Instead you have taken the liberty of stealing everyone’s money only to invest it with a roll of the dice gamble, only worse, the odds are against the tax payer getting a return.

It has become overwhelmingly clear you have almost no clue what you are talking about. You are nothing more than a fanboy, like the people I’m sure you hated with a passion under Bush… Sadly you support much of what Bush did because Obama has only continued his NEOCONSERVATIVE (religious liberal) policies.

Funny you mention that “others are allowed to disagree with me.” Well under your UNFAIR system of stealing we don’t have a choice to disagree… You are closer to Bush than you would ever realize, dude. Also if you have not noticed it’s pretty much you against the rest of the United States on this issue. It’s not like there is my opinion and then “the rest” agree with you somehow. Most people agree you are full of shit. Just re read the thread, you have to defend you position non-stop while getting support for FUCKING TM of all people hahaha.

Where did I say anything about breaking the law? I claimed that he ignored the law, which he did. Bankruptcy law clearly gives precedence to creditors who hold liens on material assets over those who simply are owed money. The theory behind this is pretty simple, it encourages investors who are willing to invest physical assets and take real risks in companies over those who survive on hope and a prayer. Are you going to try and claim that Obama did not ignore these laws and force me to prove you a liar by citing everyone who agrees that he did this?

Obama didn't save GM. He interfered in what should have been an orderly bankruptcy / reorganization process in order to bail out the UAW.

Bondholders were forced to take a fraction of what they were legally owed, with that funding being diverted to the benefit of the union.

The devil, in this case, was in the details of the bankruptcy plan that the government pushed through:

Bondholders -- investors ranging from large institutions to retirees just scraping by, who loaned GM a total of $27 billion -- received just 10 percent of the company. By contrast, the government's $50 billion gave it about 61 percent.

And the union -- in return for the $20 billion that GM owed its health trust -- got a remarkable 17.5 percent of the stock plus $2.5 billion in cash plus $6.5 billion in preferred stock carrying a dividend of about 9 percent.

In other words, the UAW got three to four times as much as the bondholders for a smaller claim on GM's assets. The union even boasted to its members in May 2009 that it had made no concessions on pay, health care or pensions in the restructuring.

In effect, the government divided up GM's creditors into favored and unfavored groups, then gave a fat stake in the reorganized business to the favored (a k a longtime Democratic Party donors). On top of that, Washington also ordered the shutdown of 1,650 GM dealers and another 1,000 Chrysler dealers as part of its takeover.

In last month's audit, TARP's inspector general criticized the Treasury Department for that very decision. Treasury didn't show why the cuts were "either necessary for the sake of the companies' economic survival or prudent for the sake of the nation's economic recovery." The move "substantially contributed to the accelerated shuttering of thousands of small businesses."...

It's true and it is sickening. The full faith, credit and power of the US is being squandered in an effort to buy a generation of democratic faithful with no regard for even basics like whether or not they are Americans.

To call this admin the architects o the world's biggest election fraud scheme might be an understatement.

But the sad truth is that we are on a slippery slide and even if the GOP won the house senate and presidency in 2012 they would probably best Obama at this exact same game. Just as Obama is besting Bush.

Neither party can be trusted with any power.

Let's ask ourselves - Ford and GM both on the verge of bankruptcy and millions in debt. Obama takes over GM, funds them with millions of taxpayer dollars. Forces them into banckrupcy where millons of shareholders get the shaft. Thousands of small businesses get stiffed on money GM owes them. Thousands of small business go out of business as the result of this stiffing.

Ford Does it own their own with no government subsidy. They stay solvent and their shareholders are rewarded. They make good on their debts and keep their suppliers in business. They sho far greater growth and profits than GM.

Well you are right they are doing much better. However I do not think it is accurate to claim they would have gone out of Business. I am sure you are aware many cooperations go through restructuring bankruptcy and do not go out of business.

but that would have given GM far to much power to renegotiate Union contracts to be acceptable to the Democrat establishment. So we got the bail out instead.

So now they are doing better, but they still have some serious under lying problems with profitability, and being able to effectively compete with Foreign companies which in many cases have much lower costs.

my take anyways.

If GM had gone through bankruptcy without funds from the government, it would have proceeded as in most large corporate bankruptcies. Federal courts would have determined the fate of GM. The court's purpose is not to rebuild the business but rather to work out an acceptable plan to pay back the creditors as much as possible. Such a plan would probably have involved selling off divisions that were profitable and disposing of the remaining assets. We would have been looking at an immediate lose of up to a million jobs. With the country in a credit crisis and the economy on the verge collapse, I think the decision to do the bailout was no brainer.

Well you are right they are doing much better. However I do not think it is accurate to claim they would have gone out of Business. I am sure you are aware many cooperations go through restructuring bankruptcy and do not go out of business.

but that would have given GM far to much power to renegotiate Union contracts to be acceptable to the Democrat establishment. So we got the bail out instead.

So now they are doing better, but they still have some serious under lying problems with profitability, and being able to effectively compete with Foreign companies which in many cases have much lower costs.

my take anyways.

Now it looks like GM is on the road to becoming a profitable private entity again -- thanks to Obama.

Does Obama get credit?

Obama's plan allowed GM to stiff their creditors, skip payments of billions for outstanding invoices for goods and services. Tons of suppliers went out of business as a result. Which added to the massive unemployment in the rust belt states. Obama screwed the workers in those states royally which is why he is stumping there so hard now. November will be payback time and Obama has failed so miserably across the board he is going to be hit from all sides. Obama paid back the unions for support in his election. GM will suffer their same fate over again because they still do not produce with competitive labor rates.

I recall the Obama Administration making the case that Ford benefited from the bail outs:

In remarks he made at the plant Obama, says that while others criticized his $60 billion bailout over a year ago, he chose that course because of his faith in American workers.

While Ford did not accept federal funds, Obama argued that the company did benefit from a resurgence in the industry following the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler and a $400 million in new Energy Department loan guarantees for companies that redesign their plants to make more fuel-efficient vehicles.

and more:

Now, Ford was in better financial shape and was able to weather the storm without federal assistance. That’s a testament to the hard work you all do and the choices this company made. But I don’t have to tell you, and your CEO will -- has said this publicly -- if your competitors had gone down, they would have taken down a whole bunch of the suppliers you depend on. The brand of American autos would have diminished. That would have had severe consequences for Ford.

You are kidding me right? Ford stock plumeted at the end of 09 when it was in danger of filing for bankruptcy. Down to like $1.20. I bought at like $1.90
Ford elected not to take the government offer of a bail out.

President Obama should get some credit for this because, let's be honest, he gets next to no credit for anything good that he's accomplished during his term.

GM has payed back all of their bailout money with interest and as noted, they are posting profits again now.

Some will call it strong-arming or a government takeover, but had Obama not forced the lame duck and greedy then CEO out of his position (and without a golden parachute, as for once, a rich businessman who has failed isn't rewarded), and put in place a chance for people who wanted to reinvent GM and bring forth better service and fuel economy, it seems reasonable that such a turnaround would not have happened.

So, he should get some credit, but credit also goes to the people at GM who stepped up and innovated as well as consumers who returned to the brand and bought American.

That does not make sense. The 27 billion dollars in unsecured bonds became almost worthless the day GM declared bankruptcy with or without federal funds. With the reorganization of GM, these bond holder got about 5 cents on the dollar in GM Stock. Had the bankruptcy proceeded without the government, they likely would have got nothing. Without federal funds, most of the divisions could have been sold off at a fraction of book value with only the most profitable surviving. So yes, GM was saved by the government. To have gambled on a bankruptcy court whose purpose is to recover the creditors investment would be unthinkable. No administration, Republican of Democrat would have undertaken this experiment with hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake.

The only resemblance between Ford and GM in 2008 was that they were both auto manufactures. Although neither company was making a profit in 2008, GM was insolvent. It's balance sheet was a bloody mess and they had no line of credit.

Ford was never in danger of going bankrupt. They had a strong line of credit and were in a good cash position. That's why they declined federal support.

In 2008, "GM could not tell you on any given day within $500 million how much cash they had." They were losing 15 billion dollars. In August of 2010 GM profits had risen to 1.5 billion in first 6 months and they are hiring.
Republicans are choking on this because it's turning into a real success story not only for GM but American public.
