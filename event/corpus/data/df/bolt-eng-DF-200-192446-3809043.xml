Don't know what to think really american TV and some UK newspapers basically poked major holes in the policework however,I always thought she was more involved than she let on,Iam not sure now, she certainly is an odd individual and a pathological liar but that doesn't make her a murderer and mean she should spend life in prison.I certainly wouldn't have sentenced her to death because there were questions over the evidence especially the forensic evidence. The sentence for framing an innocent man was upheld and she was sentened to 3 years and has to pay him compensation, although due to time served she was released.

A big dollar defence team from daddy Knox got them off on a DNA technicality, regardless of the non-DNA evidence like the blackout period of both their cell phones during the murder hours by both Knox and Sollecito. Will no doubt be going to the Supreme Court on appeal by the prosecutors.

It must be awful for poor Meredith's sister and mother who were sitting there having to watch them cheering and celebrating for Knox in court. So insensitive, as at the end of the day a young girl has been murdered and she seems to have been forgotten in all of this. I suspect Knox is guilty but got off through poor evidence and a brilliant PR team (her family have been rumoured to have spent Â£1 million on press.) It is sad to think that if you have enough money, you can get away with something as awful as murder.

A couple of years ago I read that it was possibly something to do with sex games that spiralled out of control and it ended up with Meredith Kercher being, well, killed.

It does sound to have been an extremely complicated case, with several people involved in being charged, interviewed, all kinds of alibis etc...

The casualty of all this has been the truth, you just don't know what source to believe tbh.

I don't understand how they managed to convict her in the first place with such rubbish evidence - that's not to say that I think she is innocent though, rather I think the case against her was pathetic and the DNA evidence was just a complete balls up. In terms of thinking she may be innocent, the fact that there wasn't a jot of her DNA in Kercher's room where she was murdered speaks volumes and the fact that the knife used as evidence against her innocence (that supposedly had her DNA on it which was then called into doubt itself) was a communal piece of kitchenware is just silly. If you've ever lived in halls in uni you'll know that your DNA is probably all over the stuff in the kitchen/bathrooms/communal areas. The other stuff about her own recollection of where she was and the mystery surrounding her mobile phone leads me to think something is fishy though. All in all I think the prosecution messed up big time and I'm still on the fence as to whether or not she was involved.

The only thing that has really struck me about this case is how the American media reported it. "SHE IS AMERICAN THEREFORE NOT GUILTY" is about the summation of the headlines over the last 4 years. Log on to CNN this morning and you may as well have been reading Fox News. Virtually no coverage of the case, no mention of the crime or Meredith Kerchner, just a bunch of Op-eds and commentaries about how she is clearly not guilty.

Fair enough, we're probably guilty of the same thing in some respects like the Gary McKinnon case (although I do sympathise with him) and the Natwest Three a few years ago, but then that was as much about a completely one-sided rendition treaty to the United States as it was about the cases themselves. This story has just been a great excuse for American journalists to slate the Italian judiciary, combined with an opportunity to show American exceptionalism at it's very worst.

<post author="Samz" datetime="2011-10-03T21:19:00" id="p60">
I honestly don't know if I think she is innocent or guilty, but just reading what evidence has been released to us - I don't personally think it's been proved beyond reasonable doubt. A lot of the evidence seems to be circumstantial.. maybe she was guilty but the police investigation was shocking and she's gotten off because of that, I really don't know.

Also, my law lecturer made a good point about the Knox family $1million campaign today.. he said that if any of his children told him they were innocent of a crime they had been convicted of he would throw everything he had into making sure they were freed - that money would be no object. She is somebodys daughter, of course they are going to campaign for her release.

Personally I think the whole 'foxy knoxy' thing was a bit disgusting, and the tragedy of Merediths death has been forgotten. I hope she has found some peace, and I hope her family can one day find the same.

People are forgetting she was found guilty of framing an innocent man and was sentenced to 3 years, of course due to time served she was released.

I still don't understand why she framed him, if she was innocent? I don't know if she murdered Meredith, I have not followed the case and it seems both sides have plenty of argument,even without the forensic stuff,Knox doesn't come off great. I personally think she had some involvement but won't say as it would incriminate her.I think there are probably other incidents where she behaved or did something and this time she slipped up,not saying she killed before just odd behaviour. But my gut feelings should not be enough to lock her up for twenty odd years. I wouldn't want to be locked up for all that time because others thought I was weird and I also happened to be a pathological liar.

I don't think so. I could see her becoming a celebrity from this - she already has book deals, a possible film and countless TV interviews in the pipeline. The American press are already treating her as some kind of hero.

There is a report called the Massei Report (you can google it) which gives a lot of info that points towards Knox being guilty. Forensic evidence shows that the murder was carried out by more than one person due to the wounds on the girl's body. It was obvious she was restrained and did not fight back in any way, indicating that someone was stabbing her while others were holding her down. This supports the theory that Rudy Guede did not do this alone. He was also let in to the house by someone with a key, and someone staged a break in to cover it up.

There is loads of other stuff on there - such as Knox's phone being turned off for hours, her not having an alibi about where she was that night, a sighting of her buying bleach and cleaning supplies the morning after at 7am...I just can't believe she has won this appeal based on the evidence found from this investigation. Even if the DNA is discounted, some of the above things just make it obvious.

TBH that whole issue of a chick banging a young boy is a grey area. Most lads would be well up for that, although I do acknowledge fully that it can lead to issues later in life.

I think guilty but the vast majority of Americans have always seemed to think she was innocent so probably the media has something to do with our perception of this (obviously). If there wasn't enough evidence for a conviction then fair enough. Seems dodgy about her lying and changing her story etc. but that's probably not that uncommon anyway.

Anybody who purports to seriously answer this question within this thread is ridiculous.

How could we possibly decide her guilt, with insufficient access to the evidence?

I haven't got a clue whether she's guilty or not.

Is there any point to this thread really? Nobody has any evidence for or against the idea that she is innocent or guilty, we haven't been privy to the proceedings, it's just going to be pages of people saying she's guilty because she has a 'dishonest face'.

So what? That proves nothing.

It is indeed suspicious but say there are 50 people at a party, someone gets murdered. 49 people have their DNA at the crime scene. Now, it wasn't that many (don't know if any other DNA was found even) but the principle should apply. Doesn't prove they did it. Proved they were there. What happened to innocent until proven guilty?

TBH that whole issue of a chick banging a young boy is a grey area. Most lads would be well up for that, although I do acknowledge fully that it can lead to issues later in life.

I bet Knox will scrub up well now that she's out of jail. I only wish I could be the first bloke she comes across, bet she'd be ravenous with desire after no men for four years.

Once again I feel sorry for the victims of the case, what I'm discussing here is a trivial aside.

</quote>

I personally wouldn't touch Knox with a barge pole. She certainly hasn't been proven innocent in all of this. She might end up sucking my cock, biting it off before slapping me with my own dismembered 'member' until I lose consciousness. Then the knife would come out to finish me off.

I feel alot of sympathy for the Kercher family. They're the real victims in all of this, as well as the truth in this tragic/complicated case.

A story change in itself does not incriminate. Supposition because you think something is slightly off doesn't prove anything. Convictions need to be based upon material evidence, which was lacking in this case. If it's innocent until proven guilty, then it needs to be compelling that she commited the crime.

Whatever the verdict, way too much information on the case was released to the press while it was still ongoing. It's disgusting how open an Italian court is, almost like public entertainment for all the gossip in the media.

Totally forgotten about the real victim here. Poor Meredith, I feel so awful for the Kercher family.

It's shocking that amid all of the media furore; like the film with the girl from Heroes that came out based on the trial, or Knox releasing a book, that the press seem to have completely detracted from the actual victim in the whole case.

None of this seems to have cleared up who actually did it, and I think Meredith Kercher's family deserve justice &amp; to find out who was guilty for the murder of her.

They both got off due to failings by the Italian police, such as errors in collecting the evidence. If that evidence had been collected properly, and without delay, it could not have been queried like it was in the appeal and they wouldn't have got off.

People here in the States are slating the Italian justice system, but given the fact this is a country that two weeks executed a probably innocent man when there was just as much doubt (if not more in his case), I think that's a bit rich!

It must be awful for poor Meredith's sister and mother who were sitting there having to watch them cheering and celebrating for Knox in court. So insensitive, as at the end of the day a young girl has been murdered and she seems to have been forgotten in all of this. I suspect Knox is guilty but got off through poor evidence and a brilliant PR team (her family have been rumoured to have spent Â£1 million on press.)

I always believed she was innocent, the DNA evidence even minus the flaws wasn't necessarily strong enough to assert a conviction especially in Amandas case, so when the DNA evidence which seemed to me to be a close shave anyway was discredited, it was only a matter of time. None of Amandas DNA was found in the room, just on a reguarly used kitchen knife which supposedly had Merediths blood on the blade, which turned out not only to be low, but incompatible with the injuries sustained to Merediths body. The entire thing reeked of the Madeline Mcann case tbh when the police tried to use the 'smell of bleach' and Amanda 'shaking incontrollably' in the kitchen bearing similarities to the 'smell of death' in the Mcanns Renault, in other words speculation from police looking for something.

The truth is Amanda Knox got herself into trouble from her innappropriate and bizzare behaviour after the murder that made the police eventually attempt to build a case against her, which or course led to the borderline torture tactics to extort a falsified story that placed her in further suspicion when changed later.

Well in fairness she has been charged, tried and convicted for slander when she tried to convince the police that a barman was guilty of the murder. Thats a little more tangible than the "evil look in her eye". <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

yes, I think there was a bra that had raffelle's DNA on it, but apparently they couldn't use that because it took 46days to be placed in an evidence bag. I don't see how he could have gotten his DNA on it in those 46 days, but there is the possibility it was planted, which is why they couldn't use it. I don't think the police planted anything though, despite what the american media likes to think.

The reason the story was changed was because of the unregulated and desperate Italian police force desperate to find answers under international scrutiny. Amanda Knox was questioned none stop for 14 hours with a suggestion of violence also becoming apparent. Even an experienced Ex-FBI agent Steve Moore agrees "I know these type of techniques and believe me if they are used properly you could even get the prosecutor Giuliano Mignini to admit to murder - I'm just surprised it took 14 hours" which is why she changed her story later on after relentless questioning left her fabricating a story that would free her from the persistant bully boy tactics and it's important to remember that there was no solicitor present, which meant the police were under no constraints in their tactics.

Too much press interference with this one.
Now it has become so hard to tell whether she was involved or not. There are so many different possibilities!

If I had to give a straight YES or NO answer to whether she is guilty or not, it would be YES.

I think she was most likely at the scene, whether she actually murdered Meredith is another story, but surely if she wasn't there at all this would have been pretty easy to prove?

Anyway, R.I.P. Meredith.

I agree that nothing we say will bring her back and that is the sad thing about all this. I just think the evidence that they didn't do it is very questionable and there is something very fishy about all this. I'm not sure the Italian justice system is very reliable from what has been said, it is all very sketchy.

I also don't agree with the press making all of this about Amanda Knox and her 'nightmare' in jail. What about DEAD Meredith Kercher who died in a horrific way? Far more of a nightmare if you ask me.

But naw, in all seriousness, I don't know what to think, her constant story-changing strikes me as suspicious, and she does seem like quite a dodgy person, but we have to go with facts, not instincts in things like this, what bothers me is that this was a horrible crime, and the real victims were Meredith and her family, and for Amanda Knox and her whole bloody family to attempt to play the pity angle in the news (at least it looked like that) is sickening.

Because the two are intertwined if she lied about them beating her then obv she did it for a reason. He lying was part of the prosecutions case for murder. Also the defamation was brought about as a defence against charges which are now shown to be false. She knew she wouldn't have to appeal the defamation charge because of time she had already served.

It doesn't prove it nothing did completely but it formed part of the original body of evidence. Also if I said she killed her I wouldnt get put in prison for three years neither would the people who chanted assassin even after she had been acquitted. For her to accuse him it would imply that she knew something about the murder or she was there.

It is justice jim but not as we know it. The yanks have OJ'd the ruling, pretty obvious that. I tell you what I think, I think she is a psycho loopy loop and probably has a history of odd behaviours from childhood, she did some fuked up things beforehand but this time she slipped up. Iam not saying she actually did the killing, do I think she was involved? yes, do I think she might have got a guy or several guys to do her dirty work for her because she was a manipulative b1tch? yes.She may not have even been in the room at the time,doesn't mean she wasn't involved. I firmly believe she was involved.

I actually think her attractiveness hurt her case,this is why I think lack of natural light and a prison diet made her seem more vunerable and helped her appeal,She didn't seem like this predatory vampiric slut that the prosecutor painted her as this time. No high jinks in the court room or flirting with the media this time..But a nice innocent american girl out of her depth. I think what got her out was she was american,some interference perhaps, and step daddy is rich,has connections and not an idiot,and worked with the media.

Knox is sorted for life now, step daddy will get all his money back and more thanks to media deals. Anyone heard of a film called midnight express? There will be a film similar to that out, and her family will make millions. That is not counting all the US media interviews. And you lot should like fox news this time, as that was the only US media network who thought she did it. I don't hear much mention of the fact the appeal upheld her conviction for framing an innocent man.

Merediths family must be devastated,thing is for her family it wasn't just about revenge but about justice and closure,thinking those that wronged their daughter in such away have been punished severely. As a supporter of capital punishment Iam not in favour of it in this case,because I said earlier I have enough doubts that knox did the actual killing,but do I think prison was the best place for her for another couple of decades? yes.

I think she had involvement but what level of involvement Iam not certain about as evidence is all over the place and I don't think those there that night are going to come clean.Wouldn't surprise me if the Black man sitting in prison for 16 yrs hasn't been slipped a tidy sum to keep his mouth shut and he won't serve the full sixteen. She could have been involved in a conspiracy without actually doing the killing. In my opinion she was the type of female who gets men to do her bidding for her.

The first sentence doesn't make sense. Her appeal for the murder charge concluded after having spent 4 years in prison, her conviction for that was quashed.

The truth is Amanda Knox got herself into trouble from her innappropriate and bizzare behaviour after the murder that made the police eventually attempt to build a case against her, which or course led to the borderline torture tactics to extort a falsified story that placed her in further suspicion when changed later.

I would have thought that it was down to the emotion she illustrated. Even though the cartwheeling at the police station seemed very surreal, the initial framing of a barman and then the slandering of the Polizia Di Stato was done out of a rather confused and dazed plea for innocence after being at the wrong place at the wrong time. She was, and still will be of good character, no matter what the media (Italian or not) thinks of her, or whether or not the whole thing was trying to pull a Casey Anthony or OJ.

Knox's prosecutor has been accused for abusing his position after it had been revealed that he mishandled past cases, such as the "Mostro di Firenze" and the case about the death of a Freemason back in 1985, and ordered the unauthorised bugging of telecommunications during the Mostro case (Source: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/03/giuliano-mignini-knox-prosecutor-conspiracy">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011...tor-conspiracy</a> ). I'm definitely not surprised that his corruption led to the fabrication of a prosecution that led to a miscarriage of justice being placed upon a rather aspiring American who has done completely nothing wrong.

let's face it, none of you are qualified to have any opinion on this really. the italian courts have spent years going over the evidence of this case, and they have 10 times the information we have, and even then they aren't sure really who killed meredith. i'm sick of gossipy old mail readers saying ''oh, just look at 'er, you can see it in 'er eyes, she's guilty as sin''. the truth is that none of us can possibly no

And this is why we have a legal system. This legal system may have initally convicted her, but the reason appeals processes are compulsory in these trials is because all good legal systems such as the italian one accept their fallability and the possibility of mistakes. this is why every murder convict in italy will have 100s of thousand spent on their appeal. in this case, the sppeal ahs cleared amanda, this means the people who have been exposed to the evidence to the greatest extent of anyone on the planet, more than some gossipy old ''no smoke without fire'' skeptic or any journalist, have decided her guilty conviction was not strong enough to stand. that is not a decision taken lightly.

so basically, deal with it. she may indeed have done it, we will never know, but to the best of our knowledge as people who have to take things at face value have to accept that she has been found innocent. that means we need to get off her back, regardless of how many theories the papers bring up.

interestingly, i've read before a paper on psychology that explains that in a lot of cases of death row/lifer being released from prison after years in america due to new dna testing, almost always the familys of the victim will actually refuse to belive the dna evidence, and continue to puish for the person to be locked up again, and scupper police efforts to find the real killer. basically, when we believe someone is guilty, we ingrain that view and it is very hard for us to ever change your mind. when people refuse to acknowledge the hours of analysis that went into the judge and jury deciding the conviction of know was untenable, they are undergoing the same flawed thought process. every time you see her face, your brain says guilty andf it will always do so no matter how many times she is found not guilty, she's a bad 'un to you

and it scares me how easy it would be to have the whole world hate you for something you may not have done. people are like a mob sometimes

The Italian appeals process offers more guarantees to defendants than any other legal system in the world, whereby only the weakest evidence is treated, not the whole case. Knox's team only had to attack the DNA evidence against her to undermine the whole edifice of the original trial. Italy has one of lowest prison populations in the world because of its lenient appeals process.

It does not matter if that is opinion because it is malicious. There is no defence of fair comment when the comment is a malicious one. Stating someone is a bitch and a whore is clearly overtly malicious, as is stating you hope they "burn in hell".

You've also ignored the libel of Casey Anthony.

I don't know that case, but people hurl insults at each other every day, they don't take each other to court over it. What I'm trying to say is, in reality, nothing would come of one malicious comment (unless it was racist or homophobic or similar). If it was tirades of abuse then it would be taken much more seriously.

I made those comments and I would still make them again. They weer insults not threats. Also, calling someone a whore does not make them one. If you call me an idiot, that's your opinion of me and the last thing I can do is sue you for making an insulting remark towards me.

Defamatory comments is when you take something that isn't true, and make it true and then publicize it to the world.

What I did was publicly insult her.Its like you calling me an idiot in the middle of the street.

Not libel. Not defamatory.

You have stated "Same thing happened in america with the casey anthony case where the wh0re murdered her own daughter."

You state that Casey Anthony is a whore and a murderer.

You do not state it as an opinion.

It also would not matter if it was an opinion or not, as it is malicious (you admit it is an insult).

If a comment is malicious, there is no defence of fair comment (the "opinion" line you seem to be talking about).

You have published these comments to the world (note however that saying even once to anyone aside from the person you're talking about can be defamation. You don't need to say it in a book, newspaper, tv or even online to defame someone.)

As you've published these comments in a permanent format, ie online in text, they are libel.

You have libelled Casey Anthony.

It's black and white.

You're very much entitled to "hurl insults" at the person you want to insult (you can't defame someone to their face - only to a third party).

However, you cannot state "X murdered their child and is a whore" when there is no proof of that.

That is defamatory.

An innocent woman being called a child killer is disgusting.

What's I'm wondering is that if Knox did do it (I personally think she did, but off due to inconclusive evidence) why? Why would you choose to allow your housemate to be sexually abused and murdered so brutally? That's what I find disturbing about this case.

I'm confused; you're saying "if Knox did do it" and "why would you allow it to happen"; the two aren't the same.

Which do you think happened?

That Knox killed Kercher, or Knox knowingly allowed Kercher to be murdered by a third party (who?).

Personally I think Knox had an involvement with her death, she might not have actually killed the woman but if she helped she's just as guilty. You can just tell she's happy to be free rather than glad she's been "proven" to be innocent. It's all about her and not the innocent victim which is sad. The media don't help either with talks of book deals and films. Making money out of someone's murder is what I find disgusting, especially when Ms Kercher's family barely afforded to attend the trial.

The technicality being "oh, the evidence is actually completely ruined"?

You can't convict people with shoddy evidence.

If you'd been in prison for four years for something you say you didn't do and the evidence is not reliable, wouldn't you be happy to be free?

Being free and being innocent are the same.

You are innocent until proven guilty.

She has not been proven guilty.

The evidence doesn't show that beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, she is innocent.

Lol, there's no need to put it like I'm stupid. I'm well aware of the law, and she got let off on a technicality because of the poor performance of the Italian police. I refuse to believe she is innocent.

Guilty people get let off all the time, it's about time you realised that just because you've not been sent down you could have still done wrong.

I dont trust this woman at all, I'd bet my house she was involved (innocent people dont change their stories multiple times, or pretend they saw someone else do it). She's a liar and she's hiding something...

But I really, really wish the bloody papers would stop calling her "Foxy Knoxy". It was on every front page today. Its so juvenile and inappropriate.

let's face it, none of you are qualified to have any opinion on this really. the italian courts have spent years going over the evidence of this case, and they have 10 times the information we have, and even then they aren't sure really who killed meredith. i'm sick of gossipy old mail readers saying ''oh, just look at 'er, you can see it in 'er eyes, she's guilty as sin''. the truth is that none of us can possibly no

And this is why we have a legal system. This legal system may have initally convicted her, but the reason appeals processes are compulsory in these trials is because all good legal systems such as the italian one accept their fallability and the possibility of mistakes. this is why every murder convict in italy will have 100s of thousand spent on their appeal. in this case, the sppeal ahs cleared amanda, this means the people who have been exposed to the evidence to the greatest extent of anyone on the planet, more than some gossipy old ''no smoke without fire'' skeptic or any journalist, have decided her guilty conviction was not strong enough to stand. that is not a decision taken lightly.

so basically, deal with it. she may indeed have done it, we will never know, but to the best of our knowledge as people who have to take things at face value have to accept that she has been found innocent. that means we need to get off her back, regardless of how many theories the papers bring up.

interestingly, i've read before a paper on psychology that explains that in a lot of cases of death row/lifer being released from prison after years in america due to new dna testing, almost always the familys of the victim will actually refuse to belive the dna evidence, and continue to puish for the person to be locked up again, and scupper police efforts to find the real killer. basically, when we believe someone is guilty, we ingrain that view and it is very hard for us to ever change your mind. when people refuse to acknowledge the hours of analysis that went into the judge and jury deciding the conviction of know was untenable, they are undergoing the same flawed thought process. every time you see her face, your brain says guilty andf it will always do so no matter how many times she is found not guilty, she's a bad 'un to you

and it scares me how easy it would be to have the whole world hate you for something you may not have done. people are like a mob sometimes

Why the need to constantly change her story and blame the murder on another man.

She might be innocent of the actual killing but she knew the **** that went down that night and wasn't somewhere else- sorry not buying that story.
