bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810563.xml		That's not very nice.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810563.xml		She then says the police are going to come over to my flat to interrogate me, and also adds that they are going to discuss this "criminal" matter with my university.As a result I freaked out for the next 48 hours, didn't eat, drink, see friends, just stayed locked in my room imagining I would be expelled from uni and that my life would basically be over.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810563.xml		Basically a prank call, having never done one.
bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810563.xml		As the police turned up, I got cautioned for ripping the guy's coat.

bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810563.xml		Yeah, once a guy broke into my friends dads car and stole a football t-shirt and something else (I can't remeber what it was).
